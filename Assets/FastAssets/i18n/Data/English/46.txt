Governor, the great strategist Niccolo Barca heard your name and the things you did for the people here. He has come to see you.
This is <font color='#fcae61'>Niccolo Barca</font>. Many call him the Falcon of the People Justice.
What you have done is truly impressive. You have saved this city from the unworthy. Now the people can take a break and live their lives.
Since you are starting out, let me help you on some of the core businesses in city management.
Since we are now between wars, we should take this opportunity to <font color='#7AFD01'>expand territories</font> and develop our base.
You need Heroes to lead your troops. I'd like to introduce two men who can help you with early development. Let's go to the <font color='#FFDF5F'>"Summon"</font> now.

We need to defeat the <font color='#7AFD01'>defense troops</font> on a land before seizing it. Our formation is ready. It's time to expand!
Select a formation
Defeat the defense troops and seize the land
After the defense troops are defeated, it takes <font color='#7AFD01'>a certain amount of time</font> to occupy it. Once seized, the land will become our territory.
Tap to collect the first-time-occupation rewards.
We can only give Seize command on lands adjacent to our territory. Now we can seize lands surrounding the newly occupied land.
Injured units will automatically <font color='#7AFD01'>recover</font> when the formation returns to the city. Let's <font color='#FFDF5F'>recall</font> the troops and let the injured recover.
Tap to recall the formation
Governor! A group of <font color='#FF2D2D'>scavengers</font> is marching toward the city gate!
Let's take a look.
Boys, I guess luck is finally going our way. Let's take the city.
The city is the last shelter for the downtrodden, the abandoned and the hungry. March forward, and today shall be your last day on the planet!
This doesn't look good. The vigilantes are in a <font color='#7AFD01'>draw</font> with the scavengers. We need to give the good guys a helping hand.
We can <font color='#7AFD01'>send a troop</font> to support that commander, giving him a better chance to defeat the scavengers.
The unit types of a troop <font color='#FFDF5F'>restrict</font> one another during battles. We should take advantage of that.
The scavengers come in Chargers. The units led by the vigilante commander are <font color='#7AFD01'>Enforcers</font>, who are <font color='#FF2D2D'>weaker</font> against <font color='#7AFD01'>Chargers</font>.
It is <font color='#7AFD01'>Bombers</font> that are <font color='#FF2D2D'>strong</font> against <font color='#7AFD01'>Chargers</font>. Dispatch Bombers, and I am sure the enemy will be defeated in no time!

Governor, Commander <font color='#d777d1'>Tristan "Lynx"</font> from the vigilante force is here.
My name is Tristan Williams. People also call me the Lynx from the People's Justice. We could not have won the battle without your help. You have our sincere gratitude!
If you are short of men here, I am sure I can be a helping hand.
Congratulations, you have just earned another powerful Hero!
Have <font color='#d777d1'>Tristan "Lynx"</font> as <font color='#7AFD01'>Commander</font> in the formation. He will help us win the upcoming battles.
Thanks to the last battle, the Heroes have leveled up, increasing Troop Strength Cap as well. This will allow you to have more men in the formation. Now we can <font color='#FFDF5F'>replenish</font> troop strength.

The scavengers are gone for now. We should sieze the time to <font color='#7AFD01'>claim more lands and gain more resources</font>.
It looks like that the city is well on track, with everything up and running now.
There is a list of <font color='#7AFD01'>Quests</font> that I made to help you develop the city and forces step by step. Do check them in time. Now please allow me to be excused. I look forward to hearing more about the city and your cause next time we meet.
Governor, you have not given any orders yet. I am sure you are working on the planning.
Niccolo Barca's Quest list is important, which can be used as the main reference for actions.
Check Quests regularly and complete the task one by one.

Congratulations! We now have another powerful Hero on board. Deploy him in the formation and let him fight for you!
<b><font color='#fcae61'>Legendary</font></b> and <b><font color='#d777d1'>Epic</font></b> Heroes have stronger combat abilities.
Deploy the Hero in the formation now.
The leadership points of deployed Heroes combined cannot be higher than the formation leadership cap. Pay attention to Leadership when you deploy Heroes.
You can abandon low-level resource lands and replace them with higher-level ones.
Governor, the resources are limited at this time, so please use them on more urgent matters.
Quest rewards are very useful since they offer more resources.
Governor, someone named <font color='#9aca6b'>Tex Kuang</font> wishes to see you.
Let him in.
<font color='#9aca6b'>Tex Kuang</font> has oustanding talents in economic and development affairs. We can <font color='#FFDF5F'>inherit</font> his Skill and allocate it to Van "Elephant".
The process of Skill Inheritance will consume the Hero donating the skill. Make sure you inherit the most useful skills.
Tap to open Skill interface
Tap to open Skill Inherit
Choose a Hero to inherit the skill
A newly inherited skill has to go through a Drilling process before it can be allocated to other Heroes.
Similar to inheriting a skill, Heroes chosen for drilling will also be consumed as a cost to finish the process.
Select Hero cards as drill material
The drill is completed. We can <font color='#FFDF5F'>allocate</font> the inherited skill to a Hero now.
Tap to open the Hero interface
Select Van "Elephant" to learn the skill
Learn the inherited skill
The skill is really helpful, Governor. I will make good use of it.
Van "Elephant" has learned the new skill <font color='#7AFD01'>Encourage</font>. you can <font color='#FFDF5F'>appoint</font> him as a city officer to handle city development affairs.
It is an honor to have you in my army.
I have heard so much about you, how courageous and how capable you are in battles. It is an honor to finally meet you in person.
The honor is mine, sir. Every military man would want to fight alongside Tristan the Lynx.
Governor, more and more Heroes have come to join us. We need to give more people a chance to contribute in the battlefield.
How do we achieve that?
We need to set up <font color='#FFDF5F'>Cadet Program</font> in City Management, which will allow us to deploy a second deputy in each formation.
[Cadet Program] Upgrade Cadet Program<br>to unlock more deputy slots in the formation.
After Cadet Program is built, we can deploy <font color='#7AFD01'>three Heroes</font> in the same formation. Make sure we deploy all the deputies and replenish troops.

I don't care
The current territory is at a lower level. You will get much more resources collecting on lands of level 3 and above. Do you wish to continue the collection?
Soldiers, time to go home!
