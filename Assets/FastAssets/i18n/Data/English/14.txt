Haddad served as priest and command in Solomon's militant cult, the New Dawn, and fought against the planetary government. Ambitious, committed and eloquent, he was the main contributor of the quick expansion of the New Dawn movement, bringing people to believe that Solomon was the chosen one by a superior alien race to save the poor from the tyranny. The New Dawn rebels suffered a series of losses in battles when warlords, including Don Calamity, Rico Franklin, Polaris and John Ramsey, formed the alliance and attacked them with combined forces. Haddad kept leading the resistance in the north. When sieged by John Ramsey's forces, he was conspired against and killed by his own men. The head of Haddad was chopped off and sent to the alliance as a gift to negotiate surrender terms.
Benjamin Celmy was among the first to follow Rico Franklin when the combined force was formed by Don Calamity, Max Baptiste, Rico Franklin and John Ramsey to fight Solomon and his New Dawn army. He served as the second-in-command in Mario Marshall's forces for several years. Benjamin gained the reputation as the "Magical Deputy" for being the deputy commander of superior combat skills and experience who helped Mario multiple times in critical moments. Despite his superior talents as a military man, he was not really favored by fortune. He and Mario lost several times against the People's Justice and the Ascended, including losing the Cage to John Ramsey, who was advised by the famous strategist Kubry Marcus, and UCA's defeat at the Port of Noyce, where they were summoned to lead the outposts. His real turn of fortune happened after the alliance between the People's Justice and the Ascended fell apart. Benjamin had then been promoted to major general in the army and led the attack against the Ascended in the Meteor Vale alongside Lieutenant-general Kasowski, a strategist-turned commander, and Joyce Arcbar, one of UCA's top commanders. Joyce, following the advice of Kasowski successfully lured Merak's forces out, when Benjamin was able to cut off the enemy from behind with only a small number of troops and destroyed several hidden communication transporters. Although Merak was able to escape to safety, the strength of the Ascended was heavily diminished with two-thirds of their elite troops gone in the battle. The victory won by the UCA in the Battle in the Meteor Vale was vital to secure a long-run peace and good order on its south-east borders. 
General Owain Phavreau was a wise and benevolent warlord, philanthropist and a lover of peace from the Fertile Valley. In his eighties, Owain was a cautious, contemplative, and subtle old man. He was also a firm supporter of the legitimate Planetary Government. However, he did not let on his opinion quite often. As the most powerful warlord in the Fertile Valley, he helped to rule the city of Asphodel for years and was loved by many for his effective governance and transparent leadership. Since the day Owain was told Don Calamity seized power in the Capital, he had worked at the downfall of the tyrant in secret. A childhood friend of Max Baptiste, he supported the founding of the UCA and Max's nomination as the leader of the alliance. He also sent his best specter troops to join the alliance army in an effort to remove Don Calamity from his power. After Don died and the warlords began to fight one another, Owain decided to lie low while strengthening his own capacity in the Fertile Valley. Rumors had it that he sponsored the attackers who ambushed Polaris as an attempt to recover the Encryption Key of the Babel Tower which Polaris took away, for Owain was a conservative who did not approve a cyborg's obtainment of the strategically important technical asset of Unity. The general never denied his involvement and yet clarified that he did not possess the Encryption Key. Owain helped John Ramsey once with men and money when John was on the run from Rico Franklin, a surprise to many as he always remained neutral since the beginning of the Unity Wars. Some speculated that Owain came to believe the fall of the old government would be inevitable and saw in John the military prowess and vision of becoming the next conqueror. General Owain died of old age, a fortunate way of death considering the chaotic times. Owain's taking no side in the war also kept the Fertile Valley largely free from conflicts and bloodshed. After his death, the UCA forces marched into Asphodel and Hywel Phavreau, son of Owain, surrendered to Rico Franklin. The Fertile Valley fell into the control of the northern warlord. 
Jorrah Hunt was a military man serving in the UCA forces, who was famous for his military talent and failing health.

Due to his unstable physical conditions, Jorrah missed many battles in the early stage of the war against the Ascended and the People's Justice. Jorrah came to the peak of his military career when he assisted Conrad Isen as a top commander of the enforcer regiment in fending off the People's Justice's attack to the Middle Lands, known as part of the Barca's Crusade. Later during the Battle of Iron Teeth, Jorrah assumed the commander position again and almost had the upper hand over Kenta Omoi, Niccolo Barca's student and successor, when he suffered fatal injury trying to save the life of Clovis Isen, the young and talented strategist of the UCA, and soon succumbed to his wounds.

Raised in a local bandit clan, Xosah grew up among rogue assassins, soldiers, thieves and rapers. Leading his own bandit clan, Xosah took out cell towers, broke into arsenals and destroyed military stations. He never turned on the civilians though. He rendered if he did, he would feel bored as there was no fun or enough sport. Xosah came to work for John Ramsey the Lion after his People's Justice wiped out the bloody New Dawn rebels who killed half of his own men. He served as a major general in John's army to return the favor, as Xosah would put it every time he was asked for the reason of joining the People's Justice. He operated under the code name "Cheetah" and commanded the specter troops. During the Battle at the Three Craters Dam, Xosah fought alongside John Ramsey. He managed to take out Darius Bloodclaw, the human general serving in the Ascended forces who smuggled explosives into the camp of the People's Justice. However, although Darius was dead, the bombs were in place already and triggered remotely by the cyborgs. John the Lion had to call for a full retreat with fire raging everywhere.

Aris Summers was a strategist-turn commander of Lucien's enforcer troops. He was a cunning, flexible and utilitarian military man. During the Sack of the Capital, after Lucien, his superior, stabbed Don Calamity in the chest, Aris stayed behind though Lucien decided to leave for New Avalon for shelter. After weighing pros and cons, he picked Rico Franklin since "the self-centered yet visionary man looks like the winning side". He joined the UCA and was later appointed as major general. During the Battle of Storm's Edge, when Rico Franklin was closely pursued by Luqa Storm, Iago Storm's furious son. He worked with Cameron, Rico's military advisor, to draw a wedge between Luqa and his henchman and best commander Sabas Shale, who in the ensuing operation betrayed Luqa. The strategy worked perfectly well as Sabas' betrayal took away half of Luqa's troops and forced him out of Storm's Edge. Sabas was subsequently supported by the UCA to grasp the control of the vast Outskirts, which technically make Rico Franklin the ruler of all three sectors in the north. 
Vieira McCoy was a military strategist, tactician and able statesman. Politically astute and ruthless, Vieira provided useful advice to Max Baptiste, the warlord he pledged loyalty to. Vieria graduated from the Prime University and worked in the Capital as a trade consultant for a few years before moving to Titanus. He proved to be an able and shrewd politician during his service in the office of economy, working for Max Baptiste. When things became nasty in the Capital, with warlords from every corner of Unity began to fight one another to seize power, Vieira was promoted to become a senior advisor to Max on state and military affairs. After Don Calamity died, Vieria strongly suggested Max should deal with Rico Franklin and John Ramsey first, as he deemed the two as ambitious warlords who would become dangerous opponents once they seized more military power. He even planned an assassination plan targeting John Ramsey which was rejected by Max, stating it was too ruthless that any gentleman would refuse get involved. Vieria also suggested the Battle at the River Forks should be fought quickly, devouring Rico Franklin before he could accumulate enough forces. However, the Baptiste's army was still slow in operations, giving the UCA time to implement the strategy forged by River Dean and Quentinn Spaatz and eventually win the battle. Vieira later served as the military strategist in the garrison troops of Titanus, alongside Uri and Zero Lee. He died of severe injury when his convoy was tracked down and remotely stricken by Joyce Arcbar, the major general of the UCA forces.

Himilco worked for the Planetary Government prior to the New Dawn Rebellion. After the Capital was sacked by Don Calamity, he fled to Ascension, where he later came to know Kentarus and started to work for him on both military and diplomatic affairs. On the military side, he supervised the Strategic Reserve Program which trained new cadet officers. On the diplomatic side, given his unique link with Niccolo Barca, the legendary strategist in Heartland, Merak, following the advice of Kentarus and AlphaCen, assigned Himilco a secret mission to visit Heartland as the droids and cyborgs wish to seek an alliance with humans in Heartland. Himilco managed to meet Niccolo in person and expressed the intention of the Ascended while his younger brother, after winning the trust of John Ramsey, had the same plan. Soon Niccolo would pay a formal visit to Turing, where the alliance would be formed.

During the rapid expansion of the UCA's military capacity, Tam stayed close to the center of power and offered his counsel to Rico and his son Joseph. After Rico died, Tam was heavily relied on by Joseph. He supported Joseph's decision for Operation Thunderbird. Since he always remained loyal to Joseph and good at talking his way out of crises, he stayed clear of trouble even after the military operation went south. Tam had his daughter married to Clovis Isen, son of Conrad Isen, making sure that he not be affected in case Joseph's ruling was toppled by Conrad. His plan turned out to work pretty smoothly for him and his family. 
Rezon was a New Dawn insurgent who admired Solomon fervently. He was the younger brother of Haddad. Strong, wild and reckless, Rezon constantly upgraded the New Dawn's arsenal and formed the shock trooper forces for Solomon. While his brother specialized in nanobot medicine, Rezon was an armoire expert who weaponized the core of Haddad's nanotechnology to build a new generation of Frontier Justice guns. With his contribution, the New Dawn cult started to rapidly build up and update their arsenal and became more aggressive and assertive in expansion. Rezon confronted Sir Aerin Caine, a general of the Unity Defense Army, and his forces near the North Canyon. While he gained an upper hand with his troopers equipped with enhanced firearms, he was lured into the canyon by the more seasoned commander Sir Aerin, where he received heavy bomb raids organized by Rico Franklin, Sir Aerin's ally. With all the retreat routes cut off, Rezon was killed on the spot. Since he commanded the largest and strongest Bombers of the New Dawn, the disastrous defeat and his own death was a heavy blow to the insurgents. The battle was later referred to as the Bombing of the Dawn.

He sent out scouts who pinpointed the location of Rezon, the weapon specialist and also a shock trooper commander of the New Dawn insurgents. Though Rezon gained the upper hand with his troopers equipped with enhanced firearms, the Frontier Justice, over Sir Aerin's troopers on the battlefield, Sir Aerin quickly orchestrated a retaliation plan against the rebels. Leading his main forces, he pushed Rezon and his men into the North Canyon and cut their route off before pulling his own troops out abruptly. Rico Franklin then bombarded the place intensively for continuous hours. Rezon never came out of the canyon again. Since he commanded the largest and strongest Bombers of the New Dawn, the disastrous defeat and his own death was a heavy blow to the insurgents. The battle was later referred to as the Bombing of the Dawn. Sir Aerin, though a seasoned warrior and a man of honor, was never good at politics. When Don Calamity seized power in Colony Prime, although he was not instantly affected, he was later seen as a dreadful threat by Don and was put under house arrest. Sir Aerin later died a chill at the age of fifty-five, which was speculated by many as the result of a murder framed by Don Calamity or his son-in-law, the Serpent.

"Follow the call of fate." as he described it. Sirius served in the army and was promoted to Colonel for his contribution to the battles. He was also one of the few on the planet who could get in direct touch with the Doctor, the unethical yet the most skilled healer in Unity, as he used to trade smuggled organs and parts of humans and cyborgs for narcotics and other controlled substances.

During his stay in Australis, he came to know Ridlys Renaldo, a senior strategist working for Emanuele. The two exchanged views on the situation after the Sack of the Capital and agreed that John Ramsey had greater potential in uniting the south, given that the UCA brought the north together. As a result, Ang managed to turn Ridlys, along with others who already admired John as a visionary leader, against Emanuele. With their help, Ang plotted to topple the leadership of Emanuele after he went back to Heartland and informed John Ramsey it was the right time to take River Lands. Ang further served as a military strategist in the army and raged storms on the Emanuele troops with no mercy. As a result, Emanuele, who found himself stranded in domestic strife and foreign aggression, had no choice but to surrender. In later years, Ang continued his contribution to John Ramsey's military endeavor and the growth of People's Justice. He was known as "the raven who brings the storm with him".

Dene Bola was an augmented human who worked for Emmanuel, the warlord in River Lands, as an intelligence agent, tactician, and assassin. He was known to be a witty military man, proficient killer, and saboteur. Dene was initially a human orphan raised in Ascension by a cyborg couple who did not have children. At the age of 20, he had his brain and spine augmented with cyborg technology to improve his cognitive function and physical strength, which was his own way to merge better into a society where humans were the minority. However, he was later brutally expelled and exiled by a local cyborg warlord during the power vacuum in Ascension after Polaris's death. Many humans suffered the same fate when the local lords openly supported cyborg supremacism. Physically exhausted and mentally shattered, Dene Bola arrived in Australis, Capital town of River Lands. He joined the forces of Emmanuel, where he was trained as an intelligence agent and assassin. Dene excelled at his job, thanks to both his hard-working spirit and the augmented human body. When the People's Justice was marching into River Lands, Dene was head of Emmanuel's intelligence division and a proficient assassin himself. Grateful to the warlord for taking him in when he needed a roof over his head, Dene decided to fight for Emmanuel, though they did not look like the winning side. He took the most utility of the intelligence agency, sent scouts and collected information on enemy commanders and their moves. He also helped to organize frontline defense squads in preparation for any potential operations. When Bliss the Buzzard, one of the top two strategists of the People's Justice, led his forces towards the Barren Canyon, he took a squad of specters and ended the life of the strategist the second he stepped into it. The loss of the Buzzard was not a failure that John Ramsey would accept lightly. After Emmanuel was defeated, Dene was tracked and captured by Niccolo Barca. Tired of the war and the chaos it brought to his life, he declined the offer of joining the People's Justice from Barca, who considered Dene's ability a valuable asset. He left Australis alone after promising he would never get in the way of John Ramsey or work for other warlords.

After Don was killed, Virgil took advantage of the power vacuum in the Capital and raided the President's House with Crook Crux. Together, they held the Planetary President as a hostage and planned to manipulate other warlords with the President being their puppet. Virgil turned on Crux and expelled him out of the Capital, indirectly leading to his death, so that he could pocket the victory alone. However, the crisis Virgil initiated was soon resolved by special operatives sent by the UCA who sneaked in the President's House and successfully rescued the President. Vile Virgil, who failed to escape, was executed on-site during the operation. 
Hiram was a skilled fighter, and one of the principal military commanders of the New Dawn forces wanted by the Planetary Government. Hiram fought in the Unity Defense Army years back.

His promotion was warmly welcomed by many in the war-stricken Ascension for his reputation of concentrating on economic development and people's livelihood and was called the arrival of the harbinger of spring.
Draco was a space pirate who used to control the lower stream of the Golden River. After the rise of the People's Justice in Heartland, he was forced to move his business upper the stream to avoid conflicts and thus arrived in Ascension. He was then recruited by the cyborg commander Proximo for his military acumen. Formerly a pirate, his military actions were unconventional and hard to predict. His winning streak allowed him to quickly climb up the ladder of army ranks and become a colonel. Following the Siege of the Cage, Amari Williams and his forces, upon retreat, were attacked by the Ascended who appeared from nowhere, a move orchestrated by Proximo under the code name "Operation Gold Gun". Seeing Amari have no chance to break the encirclement, Draco tried to persuade him into surrendering but failed. His idea of sparing Amari's life came from the fact that the general introduced friendly policies toward families of the pirates wanted in Heartland. However, Amari refused Draco and embraced his end-of-life. 
Lang the Raccoon was a colonel serving in the People's Justice. A former scout in the Unity Defense Army, he was agile, alerted, a fearsome saboteur, and expert liar yet with a brave and righteous heart. Lang was on a mission when he ran into John Ramsey's family, who were civilians being attacked by corrupted Unity soldiers. Lang had to kill the soldiers to save the weak and the old, but let one man escape. Knowing that his action would cause his great trouble back in the army, Lang decided to abandon his mission and escort the civilians back to their homeland, who he later found out were the family of John Ramsey. With no better options, Lang decided to join the People's Justice. Lang later served in Amari's forces as a commander of Bombers. He was promoted to colonel for his fine commanding and outstanding ability of information collection and was given the code name "Raccoon". After the Siege of the Cage, when Amari's forces were ambushed by the cyborgs during the retreat, Lang was captured by the enemy. Loyal to the Panther, he pretended to surrender to the Ascended and soon found his way out of the prisoner camp. He stole a Next Gen vehicle and drove to the nearest stronghold of the People's Justice for rescue. However, Pax the Bobcat, the commander there refused to send support immediately, leading to the capture of Amari the Panther and his men by the Ascended. Lang the Raccoon also fought in the Crusades. After the Fall of New Avalon, he stayed in Heartland as a retired military man and died of old age several years later.
Chasta Wenders aka the Young Moose was a fierce, venturous and sometimes stubborn military man who served as a major general in the People's Justice. He was one of the several young commanders who were personally taught and mentored by Niccolo Barca, the great strategist of People's Justice. Chasta was an orphan who grew up in Heartland and traveled extensively on the Planet, made friends with big names and small folks. Once a strong and naughty little boy, he grew into a slender, tall and fit man. He fought bravely in the Long War in the Middle Lands, which got him promoted to major general after John's conquest of the Middle Lands. More than a skilled fighter, Chasta proved himself an intelligent and capable commander. He used his connections in the Forge to drive a wedge between Joseph and Conrad Isen, resulting in Joseph demoting Conrad and rejected his military operations in the Middle Lands and Fertile Valley, which the People's Justice bordered. This helped Niccolo Barca gain more time in preparing for his ambitious crusade to the north. However, during the First Crusade, Chasta was so confident in himself that he ignored Barca's order of retreat in one battle. His recklessness led to his forces marching directly into the UCA trap and creating significant casualties among the Heartlanders. Though Chasta escaped to safety later on and returned to Niccolo, the top commander of the crusading army, he was dismissed of his duty and put in prison. 
Pax Ramsey the Bobcat was a skilled fighter and John Ramsey's adopted son. He was also cautious and insecure by nature. Pax was already in his teen years when he became the adopted son of John Ramsey the Lion, who was the leader of the People's Justice. Both of Pax's parents died in fighting for John, making the Lion decide to take Pax in as his adopted son and student. Pax then received professional training, which turned him into a skilled fighter and fine sniper. Pax later became a commander of specter troops. He fought bravely in the Long War in the Middle Lands and was then given the code name "Bobcat". Knowing that John was one of the three most powerful warlords on the planet, however, Pax was cautious in action. He could be overwhelmed by the doubts that he may look like a failure and disappointment to his adoptive father.Following the defeat in the Siege of the Cage, he met at his stronghold Lang the Raccoon. Lang claimed that they were ambushed by the Ascended forces and required Pax to send rescue troops immediately. Pax had known the cyborgs for being their ally, not the enemy. At the same time, he personally not trusting the "Rascal Raccoon" as much as his father did since the raccoon was a scout from the Unity Defense Army originally. Pax decided to confirm the information with other sources. The delay in action directly resulted in the capture and subsequent death of Amari the Panther. Pax's greatest fear became a reality since the loss of Amari Williams was perhaps the most dreadful blow to the People's Justice. As a result, John Ramsey demoted and distanced from Pax afterward. 
Liam Franklin was a lean yet tough young man with a clean-shaven face and short hair from the famous Franklin family. He was ambitious, aggressive and highly militant, hoping to make his name known in the times of chaos. His potential was noticed by Jorrah Hunt, a military strategist of the UCA, when he enlisted as a charger. He learned military tactics and how to fight on the frontier in the war from Jorrah, which helped him climb quickly in the UCA ranking. He was promoted to major general after the Battle in the Meteor Vale. When Joseph controlled the UCA following Rico Franklin's death, he assigned Liam Franklin as Commander of Operation Thunderbird, supported by Lieutenant-general Kasowski and Colonel Rendyl Reynolds. It was a military operation targeting at Turing and bringing down the Ascended. Liam made an ambitious attempt to bypass the defense of the Ascended by secretly crossing the Golden River in the south to attack Turing by surprise. His plan resulted in a feast of blood for the UCA forces, who were on a killing spree pushing near Turing. However, the Ascended reacted quickly, thanks to the strong defense capacity and arms accumulation, which the cyborgs developed on a daily basis. Met with stiff resistance, the UCA was defeated in both northwest and west fronts. With Lieutenant-general Kasowski killed, Liam admitted failure and had to pull back to Hestia's Valley. Liam later worked with Conrad Isen, the great strategist of the UCA, to guard the southwest borders neighboring Heartland, where he managed to fend off Barca's Crusades.
Jiro Andou was a renowned scholar from Hestia's Valley and Rico Franklin's loyal supporter and moneybag. He was an able and shrewd statesman who brought great prosperity to Hestia's Valley and the Great Mines when he oversaw the industrial and technology sectors. The Andous was among the oldest and largest families dating back to the beginning of the Unity colonization. Jiro supported Rico Franklin in his early years and during the swift expansion of the UCA during the chaotic times. He was also an excellent teacher and mentor, as his son Oda Andou would later become one of the most prominent strategists in state and military affairs. Jiro was never a fan of wars and had no thirst for getting involved in any battles. However, he deemed Rico Franklin's conquest necessary as he believed Rico as one of the very few who could unite the shattered planet and restore order and peace. He was a personal tutor of Joseph Franklin, Rico's second son and successor. He advised against Operation Thunderbird, the military attack targeting the Ascended. Jiro strongly suggested that they should focus on reform and development, especially on the strategically important mining and fuel industries. He supported Conrad Isen's military operations against Barca's Crusades in the southwest borders. He deemed them necessary since the People's Justice was much more ambitious in taking back lands than the cyborgs were. 
Hans Franklin was a seasoned warrior and commander in the UCA. Serving as a major general in the army, he was courageous, proud, and protective of his honor. Hans was Rico Franklin's youngest cousin and loyal supporter. Rico brought Hans with him into War when he decided to crack down on the New Dawn rebels. Several years later, Hans was able to command Rico's troops in fighting against Don Calamity's Primary Special Operations Force, and had multiple victories. During the Battle of Storm's Edge, faced with the unstoppable Luqa Storm, the furious son of Iago Storm who desired so much for vengeance, Hans was composed and highly alerted, making sure that their forces were not located or caught up by Luqa. When Rico's own convoy was founded and ambushed by Luqa, Hans arrived in time to intervene. He crash-landed his own combat vehicle arbiter into a mountain of ruins to hold Luqa's man from pursuing and won Rico time to pull back to safety. Hans was later assigned to guard the Middle Lands and secure the southwest borders against the People's Justice in Heartland. 
Jango Franklin was a skilled fighter who grew up in the army of the UCA. He was the third son of Rico Franklin and a student of Damon Cooper, UCA's kungfu master, from whom he learned martial arts. Jango was highly disciplined, brave, sometimes hot-tempered, and, most of the time very proud. He was a full supporter of his father's cause to unite the planet and trained hard to make sure he was ready for every battle to come. Jango worked with River Dean, the young visionary strategist, to prepare for the attack on the Dark Bandits in Baptisland as part of the plan to undermine the power of Max Baptiste. Though River died untimely due to an acute illness, Jango assumed commander, marched as planned, and defeated the notorious bandits and their leader, turning their hideout into a completely scorched earth known as the Conquer of the Dark Bandits. After the battle, Jango was promoted by his father Rico to Major General. 
Rendyl Reynolds was a seasoned, smart, and bold military officer who served faithfully in Owain Phavreau's forces, commanding the enforcer troops. After Owain died, his son Hywel surrendered to the UCA and thus Rendyl joined Rico's forces. Though he was given the rank of colonel in the army and recognized as a capable military man by his UCA colleagues, he did not quite enjoy the new life. Rendyl was nostalgic for the old life in Asphodel and felt he did not honor Owain's vision for their homeworld, which was respected by Rico Franklin. Rendyl fought in the Battle at the Port of Noyce and the subsequent Long War in the Middle Lands. After Rico's death, he continued his service in the army and was trusted by the Franklin family. During Operation Thunderbird, the attack launched by Joseph Franklin targeting sacking the city Turing of Ascension, he assisted Commander Liam Franklin in assaults. After their forces were defeated by Pegasi of the Ascended, he saved Liam out of a forming siege by the Ascended by repeatedly ambushing the cyborgs with elite enforces and secured their retreat into Hestia's Valley.
Uri was a military strategist and proud politician in Titanus. He was a close and loyal friend of Max Baptiste and worked as a senior advisor for him. Uri was brought up in Titanus and very protective of his homeland. Although he was more of a man of wits and tongue, he had been trained at arms and showed great bravery in battles. He supported Max Baptiste's decision to fight against Rico Franklin at the River Forks. However, Uri disagreed with Colonel Fionn, commander of elite enforcers and a good friend of his, on the military capacity of the UCA, rendering them no opponent of the Baptiste's powerful army. After the sound defeat in the Battle of the River Forks, he went back north to Titanus and guarded the Capital of Baptiste with Zero Lee and others. When the city was sacked and his colleagues either killed or having surrendered, he refused to retreat further to the north and stayed to fight the invaders. In close combat with Dwayne Dowding, the lieutenant-general of the UCA forces and skilled fighter, he was shot on both arms and the left leg. With multiple injuries and also broken ribs, Uri died by the ruins of the Titanus city walls. Dwayne later recalled the scene to Zero Lee, who was captured and surrendered during the Sack of Titanus, "Uri fought bravely and honorably." 
Sabas Shale was a fierce and dangerous warrior from the Outskirts serving in the Deathwheel troops and Iago Storm's best commander, adopted son, and henchman. Fearsome, unpredictable, and sometimes short-tempered, Sabas was born to be a fighter. He continued to serve Luqa Storm after Iago was killed upon a scheme forged by Rico Franklin. He supported Luqa in waging war against the UCA, and together, they initiated the Battle of Storm's Edge. However, Sabas was also changeable while being bloodthirsty and aggressive. His personality was used by Cameron, a UCA strategist, against him and Luqa. Although the Deathwheelers look like the winning side at the beginning of the battle and almost got their hands on Rico Franklin, Cameron managed to sabotage the relation between Sabas and Luqa, successfully turning Sabas against his lord. When Sabas was about to strike Luqa, his intention was discovered and Luqa, a more skilled and agile fighter, managed to disable Sabas and escaped. Although bad injured, Sabas survived and went back to the Outskirts, ruling the region with the support from Rico Franklin. 
A cyborg from Ascension, Crook Crux was calculating, cruel and had a strong desire for power and wealth. He was once the leader of Dusty Sons, a hired gun company mostly made of rogue cyborgs and lived by plundering and reaving. Since Crux was no man of honor, the reputation of Dusty Sons fell to such a low point that no warlords in Ascension or nearby would hire them for missions. When Don Calamity was massively recruiting to expand his military power before marching to the Capital, Crux pledged loyalty to Don and served as a colonel in the army. When Don ascended to the peak of power by taking advantage of the victory against the New Dawn cultists and manipulated the Planetary President as his puppet, Crux became a direct beneficiary who exploited the people and resources in Colony Prime. He also conspired with Vile Virgil, another opportunist and military officer, to remove a dozen of government officials who got in their way. After Don was killed, there was a time of power vacuum in the Capital when Crook Crux and Vile Virgil put up an armed coup to seize more power. They raided the President's House and took the President as a hostage, dreaming of becoming the next conqueror after Don. However, Crux was then betrayed by Virgil and driven out of the Capital. Because he was stripped of weapons and barely had any food or money, Crux was killed by unknown bandits. 
Linus Storm was the youngest son of Iago Storm and brother of Luqa Storm. He was a capable mechanic, brave young man, and qualified warrior. Linus joined his father's Deathwheel forces at the age of sixteen when he was still a college student. When his father Iago answered the call of Rico Franklin to remove Don Calamity from center of power, he was still a student of mechanical engineering and advanced robotics at the Prime Univeristy. After obtaining the message, Linus left the Capital abruptly, fearing that he may be kept hostage and used against his father. Linus subsequently joined the army in the Outskirts and grew into a qualified military officer. His professional training as a robotic and mechanical engineer allowed him to upgrade armed combat vehicles for the Deathwheels, making them more dangerous and lethal. When Iago Storm received an invitation from Rico Franklin, the UCA leader who saw him as a dangerous threat, Linus accompanied his father in going to the Forge. Though the Deathwheelers knew it to be a perilous scheme and yet still tried to use the chance to end Rico Franklin, their counter-scheme went south. Linus was captured and executed, along with his father, by the UCA. He was only eighteen years of age when he died.

After John Ramsey's conquest of the River Lands, Neris was recognized for his trade and economy expertise and invited by Niccolo Barca to work in Heartland. He worked hand in hand with Tarko Torres the Camel, introducing effective policies that boost the growth of the economy in Heartland and River Lands. After Barca passed away, Neris sat on the People's Defense Council to oversee state affairs and military strategies. However, seeing the supremacy that Rico Franklin had built in the north, Neris was strongly against the decision to launch any more crusades to the Middle Lands and beyond, believing that such military operations would result in nothing but a burden on the economy and stability. 
Seth Stokes the Baboon was a seasoned warrior and capable negotiator from the People's Justice and cigar addict. A wealthy farmer from south Heartland, Seth never liked the New Dawn cultists who brought so much chaos to his life and his homeland.

Gene O'Brien was a highly-skilled fighter and fine commander of Bombers. He was handsome and charismatic and yet reserved, stiff, and rarely-forgiving at the same time. Before joining the UCA, Gene served as a lieutenant-general in Don Camality's forces in the Middle Lands. Although he did not like Rico Franklin very much personally, he was persuaded by Cameron, his childhood friend who had become Rico Franklin's military advisor, to bring his men to join the ever-growing UCA army, after being a warlord for a short time. Gene's wife Vinona, a cyborg from the famous Valentin family, was beautiful, intelligent, and resourceful. Rico Franklin had a crush on her and crossed the line while he and the couple were both attending an event in the Forge, which deeply stressed Vinona and agitated Gene. When Rico Franklin was in Poorman's Hut, preparing to take the Middle Lands, Gene decided to take him down. Since there was no enemy in the proximity of Poorman's Hut, the security level was low. Gene launched a bombing raid to the place at the dead of night and sent in assassins at the same time. The incident, which was later referred to as the Bombing of Poorman's Hut, killed a dozen of Rico's men, including Colonel Damon Cooper, Rico's personal security guard and Vylan Franklin, Rico's eldest son. It also delayed the UCA's plan to take the Middle Lands. Although Franklin was extremely furious, he was persuaded by Cameron to forgive Gene because Rico himself was the one who crossed the line first, and Gene was resourceful and well respected both in the Middle Lands and back at the Capital. Gene stayed as a rogue warlord for a while. After the Sack of Titanus, seeing the strength and ambition of Rico Franklin and his UCA, Gene buried the hatchet with Rico and continued his service in the UCA. 
Elnath was one of the best hired guns one may found on the entire Planet, employed as a lieutenant-general in Max Baptiste's forces. An augmented human, he was immensely strong, quick, and alerted. Elnath was known for always fighting for the highest bidder regardless of moral codes, political sides, or religion. According to Elnath, he was born in one of the slums in Titanus and came from low beginnings. He was abducted by rogue bandits and separated from his family at the age of 10, which happened a lot to children in slums. They are ideal targets for bandits who would train them to become thieves, robber, and fighters. Elnath was selected by a bandit leader for being physically strong, aggressive, unruly, and trained as a fighter, learning combat skills and using weapons. He quickly became one of the best young soldiers in the bandit gang, excellent with blasters and guns, quick-witted, and even manipulating. At the age of 15, Elnath was allowed to participate in plundering and killing, which gained him both fame and money. He earned his bandit leaders so much money that several years later that when he asked to leave and play alone, they allowed it, partially because they wanted no trouble with the dreadful killer they made out of him. With the wealth he gained from his bandit life, Elnath travelled to Turing, where he had his whole body augmented with cyborg technology to become even stronger and sharper-minded. He then chose to become a hired gun and was later employed by Max Baptiste, the richest warlord in the north. Following the death of Don Calamity, warlords began to fight one another in seek of territory and power. Elnath once came into close combat with Amari the Panther, the most fearsome general from the People's Justice, and walked away easily.

He was also an accomplished military tactician and veteran warrior, commanding the elite enforcer troops in the southern border of Baptisland.At the beginning of the Unity Wars, when the tension started to amount between Max Baptiste and Rico Franklin, Colonel Fionn advised Max to take the lands in the Great Mines, the ore-rich area north to the Capital that can be strategically important. They must act quickly since Franklin had his eyes on the Mines as well. His opinion was adopted by Max, who sent troops down and took almost two-thirds of the lands into his control. Thanks to the richness of ore mines, the place soon became the money bag for the Baptiste family. Colonel Fionn fought for Max in many battles in the southern borders and was a revered strategist.

Loyal and devoted to the Baptiste family, Fionn chose to continue to serve Ryar Baptiste, the oldest son of Max Baptiste, after the death of Max. Unfortunately, the conflict of interests and lust for power of Max's two sons, Ryar and Pytor, led to a bloody fight that turned extremely nasty. Colonel Fionn was later assassinated by a cutthroat sent by Pytor for his picking the side of Ryar. 
Orion worked for Polaris at the Babel Tower and supported his action of removing the encryption key after the fall of Don Calamity. They left the Babel Tower together with Orion being the leading commander securing the retreat. Orion continued his service in the Ascended after Polaris was killed and worked for Mizar and Merak consecutively. Seeing Amari Williams attack the Cage and was met with fierce resistance from the UCA, he supported Proximo's plan Operation Cold Gun. The code name of the military action aimed to take down the legendary general of the People's Justice. After winning approval from the Ascended Supreme War Council, Orion carried out the operation in person. Supported by Fomalhaut, his well-trained forces devoured Amari's charger troops on their way back to Heartland, who were already weary and exhausted from the long fight.

Procion was a young colonel of the Ascended serving in the enforcer division. He was adopted at the same time with Alkaid when they were both little. Procion was raised by a logistics officer who worked for Polaris and lived close enough to their house in Turing that the two grew up together. They also attended the Strategist Reserve Program for young cadet officers during the same year. After the Ascended breached the alliance agreement with the People's Justice by capturing Amari Williams, Procion was deeply worried about Alkaid's safety, who married John Ramsey, leader of the People's Justice. He embarked on a secret mission to bring her back. When Procion arrived in New Avalon, Alkaid refused to go with him and said that staying there would be more valuable to the Ascended. Procion had to abandon the mission and returned to Turing. Procion later died fighting for the Ascended during Operation Thunderbird, the military operation initiated by Joseph Franklin and carried by Liam Franklin. He led the support unit to contain the enemy north of the Silver Causeway to win time for Pegasi's main forces to hit Liam Franklin from the west. With the mission completed, Procion's squads were devoured as well.

He was given the code name "Buffalo" for his composure, wisdom, and strong will. 
Jarvis Hark was a calculating, well-educated and witty strategist who worked for the UCA as a military advisor. He was a ferocious reader and a loyal man to those who were loyal to him.Jarvis was recommended by River Dean, Rico's favorite strategist during the early years after the UCA was founded. He liked to rely on his wits instead of the strength to solve problems, making him a constant thinker. His reading habits made him highly knowledgeable about the economy, technology development, geography, and local customs of most Unity parts. He suggested Gene O'Brien, one of the most excellent commanders in the Middle Lands, to weigh the pros and cons following the death of Don Calamity, leading to his joining the UCA. During the UCA's conquering in Baptisland, Jarvis' tactics also smoothly helped Rico Franklin siege Titanus and sacked it within two days. Jarvis is sharp of tongue and famous for saying "the bell now tolls for him", almost like a convenient curse as it worked very well to the UCA's end. 
Capella was a half-human-half-cyborg female living in Ascension with a rare kind of genetically modified DNA which she inherited from her father's side. Her mother was a human originally from Borealis in the River Lands. Capella's unique genetic heritage made her capable of conducting special cerebral activities and detecting hostile intent from humans or cyborgs within a certain distance. Since both her parents died when Capella was little, she had no clue about his father's origin. Capella studied at Twilight Academy, an elite educational institute located in Turing specializing in medicine, chemistry, and bioscience. Upon graduation, unlike many of her peers who applied to the science department of Ascension government, Capella went to work as a science teacher at one of the orphanages supported by Mizar. She was liked by her pupils for being serious yet fun, sharp, and very supportive.When Merak, leader of the Ascended, took over the management of the orphanage network established by his brother, Capella and Merak met each other when he visited her workplace.

He was indeed talented in military strategies and handling of diplomatic relations. With Sheeva's networking abilities, the UCA recruited a high number of gifted commanders. While Franklin was impressed by what Sheeva could contribute, he was annoyed by the man's arrogance and vanity. During a battle in the Long War in the Middle Lands, Sheeva misunderstood Rico's intention and ordered the frontier to pull back, as he believed there was no way for the UCA to win this time. This made Rico extremely furious. Though Sheeva was partially correct, he was executed for violating military discipline and discouraging the troops.

After the fall of Don Calamity, he warned the warlord to be careful about John Ramsey, who Tarli believed was a lot ambitious and sophisticated than what he let on. Emanuele did not take his words seriously and ended up defeated by the People's Justice, the military frontier founded by John and his protégé. Disappointed, Tarli joined the People's Justice and was given the code name Harrier. He commanded one of the best specter troops on the planet. During the Battle at the Three Craters Dam, Tarli was sent by Niccolo Barca, the Falcon, to march north and defend the borders between Heartland and Fertile Valley. Since the People's Justice was in war with the Ascended, the Harrier was in the north to stop the UCA from taking the opportunity to attack Heartland. While fending off the harassing UCA troops, the raging army of the Ascended cut off the retreat route for Tarli after John Ramsey's sound defeat at the Three Craters Dam. Unable to go back to Heartland and unwilling to have his troops devoured by the Ascended, the Harrier had no choice but led his men further north into the Fertile Valley and surrendered to the UCA. He was never blamed for by John the Lion, who understood it was not a decision that the Harrier took easily. 
Rigel was a major general of the Ascended recruited by Merak after the death of Mizar. Rigel was known for cracking down on rebels and rogue scavengers in south Ascension and finding the effective cure for an epidemic plaguing cyborgs. Those who contracted the deadly virus called Samaritan would slowly develop fatal blood contamination and be killed eventually. Rigel won a group of faithful followers for the two accomplishments. Before joining the army, he was known as one of the Four Aces of Twilight Academy, an unofficial but highly respectable title for the four top cyborg graduates by their alma mater, with the other three being Regulus, Montalban, and Han. Rigel participated in several battles against the UCA on the northern borders of Ascension. In the Battle at the Temple of Ruins, Rigel served as a major general and worked alongside Montalban, Chief Strategist of the Ascended at the time. While Montalban led the main force to meet Lance Franklin, the leading commander of the UCA troops, Rigel and Caph, another Ascended commander, led their remaining forces to detour from the west and east sides to surround the UCA troops. Lance was soundly defeated and escaped back to the Forge with only two surviving squads. Proud, resolute, and strong-willed, Rigel was liked and respected by his peers, subordinates, superiors, and everyone who knew him. When he died of a rare blood disease in Turing, many mourned and wept for him. 
Ellitia was the daughter of Lyanna Rey, an old friend of Rico Franklin, who served in the UCA and an amateur musician. Ellitia spent most of her childhood with her mother in the army. Lyanna taught her the basics of songwriting and encouraged her to pursue whatever she wanted to do despite the troubled times. Ellitia started writing her own songs when she was 11. After her mother died during the War against Don Calamity, she released her first song called "Eyes of Void," and it went viral on the planet. She stayed in Colony Prime to continue her career as a songwriter and singer. Being straightforward and sometimes unapologetically blunt, Ellitia was liked by humans, cyborgs and droids from her generation and beyond. She kept writing songs and giving a live performance, not only in the Capital and Hestia's Valley, but in the west, north and east. She was attacked on her way to Serenity of the Outskirts by a group of rogue scavengers and went missing for several years. During her capture by the scavengers, she wrote poems and songs that told the stories of ordinary people she met who suffered from the long-lasting war. Her songs were first sung among the scavengers, then by their families and later by more and more people in every corner of the planet. When Rico heard someone singing in Hestia's Valley, he recognized it was Ellitia's style. He managed to find her trace and rescue her back to the Capital. 
Selene was a clone of Eos, a female biohybrid robot from the Valentin family renowned in the universe for their exceptional beauty and wisdom. Inheriting Eos' genetic code, Selene was raised as a sister of Eos and grew up in Ascension. Though trained in combat skills from a young age, Selene kept a gentle and loving heart. Like her sister, she was taught by the greatest mind of robots and cyborgs, Polaris. When her mentor died after the Crisis at the Babel Tower, she mourned for him and swore to devote herself to the Ascended cause. Selene married AlphaCen at the same time when Eos married Mizar. She was with her sister when Mizar died in Turing due to a virus attack in his brain. Mizar hoped AlphaCen could stay and continue to advise Merak, his brother, and lead the Ascended. Selene listened to his last words and passed them onto her husband.
Eris was renowned throughout the known universe for her beauty. A former movie star and successful singer abandoned her career as she and her husband Lucien fled for their lives. With her vast personal wealth, she hoped to help fund an army for Lucien, so that he can finally step out of the shadows of the greedy and short-sighted and become a ruler in his own right.Unknown to most, Eris was initially placed at Lucien's side as a spy by the United Colonist's Alliance, hoping to gain valuable information to help overthrow Don Calamity. In the end, however, she fell truly in love with him and abandoned her UCA connections. To this day, Lucien remained unaware.
Ridlys Renaldo the Condor was a senior strategist who worked for the People's Justice. Well-educated and politically astute, he was known for sharp wits and visionary mind. Raised in the River Lands, Ridlys was deeply attached to his hometown and swore at a young age that he would do anything he could to protect his home and people. He served in the army for a while before becoming a military advisor to Emanuele, the ruler in the River Lands. After the Sack of the Capital and the defeat of Don Calamity, Ridlys saw in John Ramsey the future for the people in the River Lands. He was further convinced after his meeting with Ang the Raven, the advocate and strategist from Heartland, and thus plotted against Emanuele, who was mediocre and short-sighted, and ignored Ridlys' advice multiple times. After John drove Emanuele away, he went to see John and started to work for his People's Justice as a senior advisor in military affairs. Ridlys was assigned to oversee the defense of the River Lands by John Ramsey in honor of his contribution. Later it was his advice again that helped the People's Justice army fend off Rico Franklin's assault on the northern borders during the Long War in the Middle Lands. His strategy successfully lured Joaquin Bradley, the young major general of the UCA out of his camp, who was then sieged and killed by Baram the Goat. Unfortunately, Ridlys the Condor died in his prime years due to unexpected heart failure. His military talent and intelligence were highly praised by Niccolo Barca, who mourned deeply for his untimely death. 
Joseph was the second son of Rico Franklin and the successor of his father's cause. He was raised and trained in the army and taught by the finest scholars in the Capital. He was known for both his decisiveness in military operations and the abuse of power in ruling his people. Joseph married Lakicia Farrell, and the two had one son, Rico Franklin Jr., named after his father, former leader of UCA and the greatest conqueror on the planet, hoping that the boy could one day inherit his father's legacy.After Rico's demise, Joseph, with Conrad Isen being his advisor, immediately began to consolidate power, even going so far as to strip the Planetary President of his title. As the self-proclaimed new Planetary President, Joseph waged wars against enemies in the south and the west, including Operation Thunderbird that targeted at taking over Turing, the Capital of Ascension, and yet turned out to be a complete defeat. In the north, however, the people of Hestia's Valley had become weary of war and called for change. There were daily protests in the outskirts and within the gates of the Forge, but Joseph always turned a deaf ear. Conrad Isen no longer trusted Joseph's ability to rule and began to secretly support the people's movement. He made his support public when the protests turned to riots, leading to what became a full-scale rebellion. Joseph Franklin was forced to step down from leading the UCA and Hestia's Valley and announce Conrad Isen to be his successor and the new leader.
Eos was a female biohybrid robot from the Valentin family renowned in the universe for their great beauty and wisdom. She was raised in the Ascended and trained in combat and weapon proficiency from a young age. Eos used to be eager to prove herself that she could be seen as an accomplished young female instead of for her appearance and famous family background. After she turned 12, she was taught personally by Polaris, one of the founding members of Unity and the great leader in Ascension. Thanks to her mentor, Eos learned to keep composure and a clear mind and not to rush to actions. After Polaris died, Eos became one of the key figures in the Ascended. She was brave, loyal and sharp-witted, and assumed a lot of diplomatic responsibilities as Advocate in the affairs with the People's Justice. Eos later married Mizar, Polaris' adopted son and successor who led the Ascended after his demise, while her clone sister, Selene, married AlphaCen, Mizar's best friend and chief strategist of the Ascended. She accompanied her husband in his last days after they found out he was attacked by a virus planted by the rebel factions, and there was nothing they could do to save his life. She listened to Mizar's last words of asking Merak to lead the Ascended and AlphaCen to be Merak's primary advisor. Eos passed the word on and continued to serve the cause of the Ascended. 
Megan Momoah the Cougar was a scientist and computer engineer from Colony Prime who worked for the People's Justice as a weapon specialist. Megan described herself as "poor, obscure and plain" when it came to her appearance. Growing up, she was never liked by other girls. However, she did not feel depressed about how she looked and was judged by others. She was raised by a loving mother, who worked as an engineer at the Babel Tower, and from a young age, Megan showed her potential of becoming a great person, talented, smart, diligent, and patient. She was homeschooled by her mother most of the time and developed a superior grasp of engineering fundamentals and a high level of intuition into physics and mechanics.After the Crisis at the Babel Tower, when Polaris fled with the encryption key and disappeared from the Colony Prime, her mother was charged with treason and conspiracy against the President, and was later executed for the alleged crimes, which Megan knew she was innocent of. Devastated and furious, she left the Capital and fled west. Megan later settled down in New Avalon and worked as a computer engineer and weapon specialist for the People's Justice. Known as the Cougar, she met Niccolo Barca, the legendary strategist of the People's Justice, who grew a liking in her because of her intelligence and keenness in pursuit of knowledge. They married each other soon after. Megan's expertise in science and engineering enabled her and Niccolo to help Heartland develop faster and stronger within a short period of time. Megan loved Niccolo deeply. After Niccolo died, she passed away shortly after. 
The Connoisseur was an old man living in the countryside in the River Lands. He was proficient in politics, philosophy, the art of war, economics but had no interest in participating in any faction powers or having a seat in the Capital. His only hobby was to collect ancient objects and alien treasures. He did have a sharp eye for identifying true talents. When he met John Ramsey by accident, he recommended Niccolo Barca to the man, who was leaving UCA for Heartland.
Papa Francis became head of the Unity Church at a young age. He lived in the Capital of most of his life and held equal and merciful love for the ordinary people, especially the poor and weak. After the New Dawn Rebellion, seeing the planet torn into pieces with warlords, bandits, and scavengers fighting one another, he left Colony Prime and embarked on the road to redemption, helping those in the war-torn areas rebuild their home. He was called the Smiling Pope by grateful commoners.Papa Francis was known for supporting the vision of John Ramsey to bring true freedom to the people, and despising Rico Franklin's seek of supreme power, calling him an ungrateful and greedy man. Though belief was never treated as important as it was hundreds of years ago, Francis pursued with his serving and teaching. Rumors had it that his prayers were heard by God, and sinister he marked would be punished sooner or later. 
The Docter was a trained professional working at the Capital before being stripped of his medical license for engaging in forbidden experimentation on humans using alien technologies. He then started his nomadic life around the planet, saving people, no matter who they were and which faction they belonged to. His patients included Amari Williams, Sean Calamity, and Damon Cooper. While many surgeries and treatment methods he took looked dangerous and were reviled by many, the Docter was arguably the most talented and effective healer in all of Unity. The Docter was later imprisoned by Rico Franklin on an alleged charge of conspiracy to poison Rico during the surgery he was about to perform on him. No one heard about him ever since, and his knowledge and treatment methods were lost for good. 
Wayler was extremely strong, allegedly an augmented human, known for his violence and cruelty on the battlefield and a sadist in life. From the renowned Pike family in the Baptisland, Wayler was born a fighter. Though he was unfit to command troops, Max Baptiste considered him a valuable asset to destroy enemies in close combat and appointed him lieutenant general of the Baptiste Royal Army. Before Rico Franklin reached the River Forks, Wayler led his forces and fended off Dwayne Dowding's troops. However, Wayler was later slain by Amari Williams, General from the People's Justice, who promised Rico Franklin to repay his debt by destroying Max's defense.
Gabor was a hired gun and a freakishly tall man called "the Tall Gabor" by people in the Capital. Immensely strong, fast, and bold, he served as a general in the Don Calamity's army and Commander of Primary Special Operations Force, which was actually controlled by Don Calamity instead of the Planetary President. During the war waged by the United Colonists' Alliance aiming to drive Don away from Capital and restore order and justice to the planet, Gabor led his army and defeated the troops of Max Baptiste, killing two of Max's best commanders. Seeming to be on a killing spree, Gabor was taken down by Amari Williams, sent by John Ramsey to rescue the main alliance forces. The loss of Gabor was a major blow to Don Calamity. 
Juan was Wayler Pike's older adopted brother. Growing up together, Juan was less cruel and violent compared to his brother, yet similarly strong and skilled in killing. Serving in Max Baptiste's forces as a general, Juan led Max Baptiste's Elite Force and swept across several towns controlled by Harris Baptiste. When Juan heard that his younger brother Wayler was killed by Amari Williams, who at that time served Rico Franklin, he fell into great fury and went after Rico's troops, ignoring Max's order of retreat. Like his brother, he managed to defeat Dwayne Dowding and took the resources for his own. However, he was then caught up by Amari Williams and shot dead in the head. 
Iago Storm was among the warlords who answered the call of Rico Franklin and led his Deathwheels to attend the meeting at the Capital that formed the United Colonists' Alliance (UCA) with an aim to drive Don Calamity from the Capital and restore peace to the planet. Seeing in Rico Franklin the possibility of becoming the next Don Calamity, Iago plotted together with Mace Sullivan to assassinate Rico, but the plan was exposed before they took action. Iago managed to escape and fled back to the Outskirts with his army.Rico Franklin saw Iago as a dangerous threat and swore he would chase him down and kill him. He sent an invitation to Rodric, asking him to come to the Forge to attend a meeting. Knowing it to be a scheme aimed to kill him, Iago did not cower but saw it as a chance to end Rico Franklin and went anyway. Unfortunately, Iago's plan failed again. The Deathwheel army was defeated and he, together with his son Linus, was executed by Rico.
Major General Crasinski of the Planetary Defense Army was a brave and loyal friend to Lucien. He was fair, dignified, and well-disciplined. He continued to serve as a major general in Lucien's army after the death of Don Calamity. He was Commander of the Oppressor forces and was known for enforcing strict rules on troops under his command.After Lucien was defeated by Rico Franklin's forces, it was Crasinski who helped Lucien's family escape. He guarded New Avalon after Lucien defeated Victor Nguyen and took it over by force. When John Ramsey returned Heartland and sieged the city, Crasinski fought for Lucien until the city fell. Crasinski refused to surrender and died in single combat against Victor. 
Mizar was the son and successor of Polaris as the leader of the Ascended, a cyborg ruler who was visionary, kind and protective of his own people and yet died at the hands of rogue droids. Was abandoned at birth in a sewer in the dead of night and was found by Polaris, who happened to be taking an early morning walk through the Capital. Finding Mizar's tiny body broken at the bottom, Polaris wrapped the child in his shirt and quickly returned home. He swiftly ran diagnostics and managed to save his life with cybernetics. Mizar's body was now approximately 70% cybernetics, including about 60% of his brain.Mizar, as Polaris' adopted son and pupil, grew up spending most days with his father and learning everything from communications protocols to wisdom in governing. He inherited his father's philosophies in race and equality. He established a network of orphanages across the new territory of Ascension and served as Polaris' most trusted advisor, given charge of Ascension when Polaris was away.Upon Polaris' death, Mizar became the leader of Ascension. He married Eos, a female biohybrid robot from the famous Valentin family and also a pupil of Polaris. With the help of AlphaCen, Eos and others, Mizar secured the borders and destroyed local warlords who had arisen during the power vacuum left by Calamity's and Polaris' deaths. The majority of Ascension was enthusiastic about having Mizar as a leader. However, a faction of androids believed a cyborg could not properly rule Ascension. They used nanobots to evade Turing's security systems and planted a virus in Mizar's brain, which drove him to madness before eventually killing him. His body now lies in the same tomb as his father's, and both are seen as great heroes of Ascension.
Aldebar, a humanoid robot, was at least 120 years old when Merak became the ruler of Ascension, but that never compromised his ability to serve as a prominent advisor. He was old yet experienced and cunning. When Aldebar was the advisor of Polaris when he joined the alliance forces organized by Rico Franklin to fight the War against Don Calamity, his strategies helped their squads avoid several lethal attacks. He was there also when Polaris made up his mind to take the encryption key of the Babel Tower and promised to protect the symbol of power with his life under extreme circumstances. After Polaris died, Aldebar served Mizar and Merak loyally. He was also a strong supporter of bringing the war to Rico Franklin at the Port of Noyce and believed in AlphaCen's leadership, though AlphaCen was much younger than him. In fact, Aldebar spent all his late years fighting alongside AlphaCen and provided insights to his commander whenever required. 
Sparrow was a lieutenant general serving in the Ascended special forces, a renowned cyborg hacker, and one of Polaris's earliest followers. He was also a close friend of Aldebar. He understood well the strengths and weaknesses of Ascension and supported Merak's decision to form an alliance with the People's Justice.When Franklin led his forces south to meet the Ascended at the Port of Noyce and broadcast that any soldiers who were willing to defect from the Ascended forces would be welcomed into the UCA, AlphaCen and Niccolo Barca sought to use this to their advantage. Sparrow led twenty of his finest specters to pose as defectors to the UCA. Franklin accepted Sparrow's surrender personally, but as Sparrow was being escorted through the camp, he managed to slip a USB into the supply drone systems. It uploaded a virus that would cause the UCA drones to crash into the vehicles they were refueling, as well as Franklin's command center, at the touch of a button. Sparrow's completion of the mission helped the alliance make a successful ambush against Rico's forces and ultimately drive them back to the north. 
Joaquin Bradley followed Xavier Bradley, his older brother, and joined the UCA when Rico Franklin summoned warlords and heroes to fight together against Don Calamity. A seasoned warrior, Joaquin was quick in action and fearless in the fight. After Rico Franklin rose in the north as the most powerful warlord, defeating Max Baptiste in Baptisland and fending off John Ramsey in the southwest, Joaquin was assigned to guard the strongholds in the Middle Lands and swore to defend the borders against the threat from John. The tension between John Ramsey and Rico Franklin soon had the area entangled in a war that would last for four years - the Long War in the Middle Lands, as people would call it. Considering Joaquin an accomplished major general at a young age, Rico reminded him to remain patient and vigilant as the war had been going on for too long that it was more likely for military men to become anxious and prone to provocation. However, Joaquin was irritated when one of the strongholds was taken by the People's Justice and decided to attack back immediately. He was sieged in the battlefield by Baram Whitebeard, the cunning old "Goat" from Heartland, and separated from his main forces. Refusing to surrender, he was captured and later executed, which was deemed as a great loss to the UCA by Rico Franklin. 
Wylde Wallace remained nobody for many years, supervising farmlands in Hestia's Valley until he bumped into Conrad Isen during his field investigation. Conrad was impressed by Wallace's knowledge and forward-looking views on agricultural planning, irrigation, and supply management. After the meeting, Wallace was promoted, and he climbed higher and higher in the UCA system. His many policies contributed to the growing strength of Hestia's Valley.He was later appointed the Commander of the West Expedition Army against the People Justice. He never lost a battle to Kenta Omoi, Niccolo Barca's student and top commander of the People Justice's army after Niccolo died. Wallace studied the map of Heartland carefully and knew all the major and minor routes leading to its Capital, New Avalon. After several months into the bitter war, While Oda Andou, another commander and strategist from the UCA, led the main troops to fight Kenta's forces, Wallace cut through the mountain areas in secret and arrived at the back of Kenta's army, marching into New Avalon after killing Waldau Barca, Niccolo Barca's son who was guarding the Arch, the last stronghold near the Heartland Capital. Henry Ramsey, John Ramsey's son and successor, surrendered without a second thought. The city of New Avalon was sacked, marking the end of the People's Justice. 
Jean-Luc Darlan was a famous lieutenant general who served the UCA for years. He came to know Rico Franklin from a young age and stayed close and loyal to him throughout his life. He was known for keeping strict discipline in his command and being a careful thinker making any military moves. When Amari Williams, the Panther General from the People's Justice, attacked the Cage, Jean-Luc led a force to rescue Mario Marshall, who was guarding the city. However, as he arrived, Amari, who was waiting for him, intercepted his reinforcements. Unwilling to see his men die for his own misjudgment, he surrendered. Jean-Luc was held captive until Amari was defeated by the cyborg forces sent by Proximo, Master Strategist of the Ascended, on his way back to Heartland. The Siege of the Cage was one of the few battles Jean-Luc lost during his military service. He was deeply depressed and haunted by it, which he saw as a huge humiliation. The mental stress ate into his health as he became severely ill and died shortly afterward. 
The Serpent was a vicious politician in the Colony Prime and son-in-law of Don Calamity. He was responsible for multiple assassinations of government officials, warlords, and businessmen, who stood in the way between his father-in-law and the supreme power. When Don wanted Eris Ning, Lucien's wife, for his own, the Serpent strongly opposed it and asked Don to control his desire. Don ignored him. The Serpent knew that would lead to an irreversible fallout between the father and the adopted son and planned for his own escape. However, he was soon captured by Lucien and executed for conspiring with Don Calamity. 
Kubry Marcus the Heron was a strategist and orator from Hestia's Valley and supported John Ramsey in founding and developing People's Justice.Kubry was famous for his writing of verse and works on warfare and politics. He was recruited by John Ramsey the Lion and served as his military advisor. He helped John win a series of battles against the UCA during the early years. Rico Franklin was impressed by Kubry's talents in military affairs and wanted him for his own. Following the advice of Renzo Clark the "Joker," Rico arrested Kubry's mother and forged a letter in her name, urging Kubry to return to the Capital. Being a tame and loving son, Kubry did not hesitate and went right into the trap. He had no choice but to agree to work for the UCA as the price for the release of his mother. While Kubry had to honor his words, he recommended Niccolo Barca to John Ramsey, an old friend of his, and told him where to find him. During his service at the UCA, Kubry kept a low profile and never truly offered any advice to Rico. 
River Dean joined the UCA upon the recommendation of his close friend, Renzo Clark, "the Joker." Unlike the presumptuous and cruel nature of his friend, River, a human in his 20s, was a man of extraordinary qualities, talented, charismatic, sophisticated and composed. The military advice he offered to Rico Franklin was extremely effective. River Dean was the hand behind the scene for the UCA's swift victory in Baptisland that drove Max Baptiste away from the land owned by his ancestors. He orchestrated the Conquer of the Dark Bandits, a move that would destroy the most important ally Max had in the north. Unfortunately, River died of blood illness during the north conquest. However, the strategies and tactics he left behind would eventually help Rico Franklin unite the north in a very short period of time. Many of the proposals that Quentinn Spaatz, another strategist of the UCA and Chief Advisor to Rico, gave was discussed with River Dean before his death. While Quentinn took some credit for the Battle at the River Forks and the Sack of the Titanus, he told Rico Franklin that River had seen those in advance and carefully planned every single move with him to make sure that the way to victory is paved smoothly. Before River died, he also warned Rico repeatedly that when the warfare in the north was done, he should tackle John Ramsey as soon as possible, as he was a man who would become a dreadful threat if left undealt with. River was not even 30 when he passed away and was often mourned with regret and gratitude by Rico Franklin. 
Joyce Arcbar was a major general of the UCA forces with an excellent grasp of warfare tactics and a dexterity in organizational leadership and technical applications. Joyce joined the UCA when Rico Franklin started the War against Don Calamity. He fought in numerous battles along with Rico and was praised for his bravery and calmness. After the Battle of the Port of Noyce, Joyce was promoted to be Xavier Bradley's second-in-command in recognition of his contribution in securing the retreat of the remaining forces back to the Forge and later assigned to guard the southeast borders of Hestia's Valley.Several years later, after the alliance between the People's Justice and the Ascended fell apart, Joyce worked for Lieutenant-general Kasowski, a strategist-turned commander, with Benjamin Celmy, another major general of the UCA, to fight against the Ascended in the Meteor Vale. Joyce accepted the proposal of General Kasowski and managed to lure out the enemy troops led by Merak, the top leader of Ascended and so-called the Last Guardian of the Stars, by diminishing his own strength and retreating slowly. Benjamin was then able to cut off Merak's forces from behind with only a small number of troops and destroyed the hidden communication towers of the enemy. Although Merak was able to escape back to Turing, the strength of the Ascended was heavily diminished with two-thirds of their elite troops gone in the battle. The victory of the Battle in the Meteor Vale helped the UCA secure a long-run peace and good order on its southeast borders. 
Jeor Marshall was a lieutenant general of the UCA, the younger brother of Mario Marshall and cousin of Rico Franklin. He was best known for leading the Unistalker forces with strict order and rules. He was also known for being a brave and yet sometimes rash commander. Jeor was a childhood friend to the Bradley brothers and tried hard to outperform them. He was sent to the Unity Defense Academy and graduate with upper second honor dgree. Upon graduation, Jeor followed his brother Mario and started serving in the UCA.After the UCA defeated Max Baptiste in the north and had the Planetary President in hand, Rico Franklin sent Jeor to replace Mario Marshall, who was assigned to another mission, to guard Asphodel, the Capital city of the Fertile Valley, as a preparation to march south, since Asphodel was close to both Heartland in the southwest and the Ascended in the southeast. Jeor received from his scout that the Ascended was holding a funeral for AlphaCen, Chief Strategist of the Ascended who allegedly died of an enduring injury. Believing it to be true, Jeor left to attack their forces. Aarav Castillo, the Wolf General from the People's Justice, then stroke Asphodel by surprise and took it into the control of the People's Justice. Jeor was held responsible for the loss and transferred back to the north. Humiliated and demoted, Jeor focused on training his Unistalker troops and improving himself in political savviness and military tactics. His diligence paid off as he managed to secure the safety and order of Baptisland against rebels and bandits and then was promoted back to his original rank as a lieutenant general. When Rico Franklin launched Operation Forsaken Garden, aiming to take Fertile Valley back, Jeor and his Unistalkers were the first-in-last-out units to ensure the success of the military operation. Jeor later guarded the southern borders of Hestia's Valley following the UCA's great defeat in the Battle at the Port of Noyce. Faced with the seemingly unstoppable Ascended forces, Jeor managed to ward off their assaults multiple times and even wounded AlphaCen, winning time for the UCA men to recover from the defeat and recruit more soldiers to rebuild capacity. 
Gil Gandry the Warthog was a skilled fighter and commander of the famous Wraith Forces of the People Justice. Gil used to be Lieutenant-general in the UCA forces, serving as Dwayne Dowding's second-in-command. During UCA's invasion to the Middle Lands, he was besieged by the troops of the People's Justice and chose to surrender. Gil was given the code name "Warthog." With his help, the People's Justice forces destroyed the shield generator of the UCA's main force and secured the victory. He was rewarded by John Ramsey for his contribution and promoted to major general in the army. Gil the Warthog also participated in Barca's Crusades, the expeditions to the north organized by Niccolo Barca to take back the Middle Lands, Colony Prime and beyond. As the top commander of the famous Wraith Forces of the People's Justice, he fought bravely and consistently throughout his service in the army. 
A self-proclaimed king, Solomon drew a massive following of the planet's poor and disenfranchised. He secretly developed his own medical nanobot technology, which he used to heal many thousands, who then saw him as nothing short of a God. Solomon established a militant cult known as the New Dawn. He rebelled against the planetary government, telling his followers that he was chosen by a superior alien race to help bring mankind into the penultimate stage of being.With his fame and tales, many came to his service, including fighters, bandits, scientists and mechanics, who helped the cult develop its military presence swiftly. As a result, the rebellion achieved several early victories through enhanced technology and superior numbers, but their lack of training and organization meant the rebellion's failure was all but certain. The Unity Defense Army and the combined forces of warlords swiftly destroyed Solomon and his forces in multiple locations. Although Solomon almost made his way into the Capital, he was ambushed by the shock trooper forces sent by the Planetary Government and the forces of Rico Franklin and John Ramsey. Solomon's hideout was detonated. With most of his troops disabled or destroyed, the king of rebels was surrounded and blasted into pieces. Scattered to the wind, New Dawn cultists still exist, praying to Solomon as a martyr and god. They now operate as a secret society, as their movement has long since been outlawed.
Born into luxury, Max Baptiste is the grandson of Benjamin Baptiste, the folk hero and leader of the first colonists to land on Unity. With the death of his grandfather and father, Max assumed leadership of Baptisland. Born with a silver spoon in his mouth, Max enjoyed the reputation his family had built over generations and lived a life of luxury as the head of the wealthiest family on Unity.Max was given charge of the United Colonists Alliance in their quest to remove Don Calamity from power. Believing himself to be the most qualified to "advise" the Planetary President, Max had plans to install himself in Don Calamity's place. His plan was foiled, however, by the disappearance of the Planetary President and the Encryption Key in the chaos of the battle in the Capital. Max returned to Baptisland and bolstered his forces, and attacked Rico Franklin in Hestia's Valley. Though he had the numbers and supply advantage, Rico Franklin had superior tactics and was able to unite the majority of the north as his domain.Max escaped death in his conflict with Franklin and managed to recruit more men to his cause, but he was never able to return to his former glory.
AlphaCen is the premier strategist and military mind in Ascension. Known across the planet for his dashing good looks, he is an android, an updated version of Polaris' original model. His ability to calculate the myriad of potential outcomes to find the strategy most likely to succeed is unmatched. As such, he was chosen to lead Ascension's armies, and later the combined forces of the People's Justice and Ascension.AlphaCen achieved scores of victories against Rico Franklin in the north and against local warlords on the borders. Most notably at the Battle of Noyce, where the combined strategic genius of himself and Niccolo Barca overcame overwhelming odds to rout the United Colonists Alliance and send Rico Franklin into full retreat back to Hestia's Valley.While AlphaCen had the full confidence of Polaris and his children, this trust was misplaced. Though he gave good advice and never once undermined their battle plans, he was at the same time secretly leading a cabal of android supremacists looking to overthrow the rule of Polaris and his cyborg children, seeing their partial humanity as an impurity which prevented them from perfect leadership. Eventually discovered by Alkaid, daughter of Polaris, she arranged his death without consulting Merak, deepening a rift of mistrust between Heartland and Ascension that eventually broke their alliance.
Polaris was an advanced droid and one of the original founders of Unity's first colony. He was a well respected and honorable man, liked by both humans and cyborgs. Polaris saved and raised several orphaned cyborgs himself, including Mizar, Merak, and Alkaid, children who had been born deformed and required cyborg enhancement to survive to adulthood and later became his family. He humbly saw them as people who would go on to be much greater than himself.Polaris began with handling communications and coordinate various AI-controlled systems. Seen as a loving father, he endeared himself to many generations of people. He was even more beloved by androids and cyborgs, who were generally spat upon by most of human society. Polaris was also regarded as the creator of Turing, which later grew into the most prosperous region of Ascension, home droids and cyborgs could call their own where they would not be seen as "the other." He later returned to Colony Prime to resume his original duties and occasionally give advice to the President. When the UCA came to take down Don Calamity, while Polaris supported the alliance forces in removing Don from the Capital, he saw in Rico Franklin yet another conqueror. Therefore, he removed the encryption key from the Babel Tower, cutting Unity off from the rest of the colony civilization in the universe until a ruler he could trust was ready to hold power. Polaris was later ambushed on his way back to Turing and died of a critical injury after being hit by a rocket-propelled grenade.
Proximo worked as Master Strategist in the Ascended Supreme War Council and later general and top commander of the Ascended army. He was determined and hardworking, famous for his modest and self-effacing personality. Proximo started his service in the Ascended army as a soldier in the enforcer troops, and quickly gained a reputation for his bravery and outstanding combat skills. He was also known for his diligence in studying military tactics and strategies. With this new depth of knowledge, he proceeded to advance quickly through the ranks of the Ascended.During the first alliance between the Ascended and the People's Justice, Kentaurus, a high-ranking droid general of the Ascended, ran into Proximo in the halls of Turing's military offices. Proximo asked Kentaurus to set up a meeting between him and AlphaCen. Having had little respect for Proximo, Kentaurus called him a brute with no mind for strategy, but out of curiosity, he did not turn him out of the door. Proximo then asked Kentaurus what strategies he and AlphaCen had prepared for Amari Williams. Kentaurus asked with a wry smile, "Why should I do that to fight an ally?" Proximo replied, "A talented leader like Amari should always be considered a risk. I believe him to be one of the greatest threats to Ascension. I have here fifteen possible strategies that may help us combat Amari's forces. I will submit them for your consideration." Kentaurus was impressed with the cyborg's understanding of long-term strategy.When Kentaurus assumed the position of chief strategist in Ascension, he promoted Proximo, who became the first cyborg to ever hold the title of Master Strategist in the army since the Ascended Supreme War Council was traditionally dominated by pure androids, a legacy left by AlphaCen. Proximo later took advantage of the Siege of the Cage, where Amari Williams had to pull back after weeks of fighting and failure to conquer the city controlled by the UCA. The Ascended successfully captured Amari, the most fearsome general of the People's Justice, on his way back to Heartland. This military action was called Operation Cold Gun.
Darius Bloodclaw was a human scrapper and intelligence agent living in Ascension. He came to knew Mizar, Polaris's son, by accident and started working for him, and later for his younger brother Merak. Bloodclaw was well connected and fed Mizar valuable information on scrapper gangs when Mizar was investigating the death of his father.After Mizar died and Merak became the new ruler of Ascension, Darius Bloodclaw abandoned his former scrapper identity and served in the Merak's army as a major general, a high-ranking position that is quite rare for a human to assume in the Ascended army. Bloodclaw was well respected though thanks to his valuable long-term contribution and easy-going personality. During the Battle at the Three Craters Dam, Darious Bloodclaw led a secret mission against the People's Justice enforces, which was led by Rohn Ramsey to revenge his brothers, especially Amari Williams. Darious managed to smuggle explosives into John Ramsey's camp. The explosions were followed by a full assault by the Ascended, and the vanguard of the People's Justice was completely cut off from reinforcements and soon wiped out. With fire raging all around them, John Ramsey looked over the battlefield and saw his front line collapsing. Urged by Niccolo Barco, John had no choice but to call for a full retreat. The effective operation of Darius Bloodclaw led to the final victory of the Ascended in the battle. In fact, Darius was the main or perhaps the greatest contributor behind the Ascended's mounting advantage over the People's Justice. However, it was also in the Battle at the Three Craters Dam that Darius himself was killed. After his mission was done, he was tracked down by Xosah the Cheetah and shot dead in the head. 
Merak was the adopted son of Polaris and successor to Mizar as the Leader of the Ascended and the Guardian of Ascension. He was a visionary and ambitious ruler and a cunning military strategist. Merak was sometimes referred to as the Last Guardian of Ascension. A boy raised in an orphanage, Merak was already working with part-time volunteers on college-level physics problems at the age of 5. Polaris heard the news and adopted him soon after meeting, naming him Merak. At the age of 6, he attended Turing University, the education institute in Ascension specializing in mathematics, physics, engineering and cybernetics, and graduated at the age of 7. Merak studied as a pupil of Polaris after graduation when he grew extremely close with his brother Mizar.Merak was distinctly aware of being the only pure human in his family without any machine parts and reasoned that without them, his father Polaris could never love him as he did Mizar and Alkaid. He took a pencil before his father and jammed it into his eye, saying, "Now you can make me like them." Polaris managed to save Merak by replacing his eye and a small portion of his brain with cybernetics. Merak would go on to actively replace many other parts of his body with cybernetics, believing that only through unity with machines can humans truly attain enlightenment. This philosophy would go on to characterize his leadership and the culture of Ascension, with many residents of Ascension electing to get cybernetics.Devastated by the loss of his brother Mizar and with Alkaid turning down the leadership of Ascension, Merak stepped in to lead the Ascended. During his reign, Merak continued the hunt for the Android faction, which had killed his father and brother and went on to consolidate his leadership of Ascension. Determined, sophisticated, and properly ambitious, Merak recruited many talented individuals within the region who would later become prominent assets to the Ascended and kept a compassionate heart to those in need and longing for changes. Given the rise of Conrad Isen in the north in later years who would eventually bring the split planet into one regime, Merak was called the "Last Guardian of Ascension." With him as the leader, Ascension saw significant increases in its territory and wealth. 
Victor Nguyen the Boar was a top general in the People's Justice. His prowess on the battlefield is second only to Amari the Panther in the People's Justice and his booming battle cry can be heard for miles. Victor was a lifelong friend to both Amari Williams and John Ramsey and a co-founder of the People's Justice. When he wasn't on the battlefield, Victor could typically be found in any local pub enjoying the evening's festivities, which typically for Victor is a good old-fashioned bar brawl.Victor tended to hold a grudge, apart from being known for his rages. After Don Calamity's fall, John Ramsey welcomed Lucien into Heartland and gave him charge of the northern border. Victor, however, worried about his position within the People's Justice leadership and began raiding Lucien's lands. As a result, Lucien marched his forces into New Avalon and took the Heartland's Capital from Victor. Then Victor contacted John and claimed Lucien had betrayed him just as he had betrayed Don Calamity, resulting in Lucien's banishment from Heartland. After Amari was killed, Victor was enraged at the loss and implored John to give him a force to avenge Amari. John agreed. A week before the attack, the Boar General was found dead in an alley behind a bar, cause unknown. Some say he drank himself to death with the loss of Amari. Some say he was murdered. Some say it was one of his bar brawls gone horribly wrong.
Aarav Castillo was the most skilled sharpshooter in all of Heartland, famous for never missing a target. He was also the commander of the People's Justice's most elite specter troops and a trusted advisor to John Ramsey. His code name within the organization was "Wolf," and his specters are thus called the Wolf Pack. Aarav and his squads came to prominence during the retreat of the People's Justice after their defeat in the north against Rico Franklin's new UCA. They were caught deep behind enemy lines and the hope of a full retreat was very slim. With snipers and best shooters in the team, they caused as much damage as they could. As they prepared to strike a UCA supply depot, they discovered and rescued a large group of the militia of the People's Justice who were being held captives. To get their forces back to safety, Aarav the Wolf and his pack led the rescued soldiers on a long winding path to avoid detection. Near a mountain pass that would see them safely into Heartland, they ran into a group of UCA scouts, who managed to password back to Rico Franklin. After securing the rest of the troops a full retreat, Aarav began what would be a days-long game of hide and seek, leading the pursuers sent by Rico on a fatal tour in the mountains and taking them out slowly, one by one. Running out of ammo, he took guns off stray soldiers and continued the hunt. His squads and the liberated soldiers had been back in New Avalon for a full week before Aarav came limping back to the city, "the lone wolf who came back from hell" as people would later call him. The final score: Aarav Castillo 42, UCA 0.
Baram Whitebeard the "Goat" was a highly skilled sniper, a seasoned military officer in his seventies, and an honorable man. Baram served in the forces of Emanuele of the River Lands for almost fifty years. He retired from service after Emanuele was defeated. However, since his military ability was known to many, John Ramsey invited him to join the People's Justice. Baram agreed. With the code name "Goat" in the People's Justice, he was also a trainer of young snipers in the faction. He contributed immensely when the People's Justice was trying to push their borders further east and north, especially during the Long War in the Middle Lands where Baram successfully lured Joaquin Bradley into the battlefield and took him out after the young general of UCA refused to give in. 
Zowie Zodiac the Bear was a lieutenant general in the People's Justice forces and top commander of the People's Justice's elite Bombers called Thor's Legion. Zowie was born and raised in Heartland. During his youth, he was already an entrepreneur running a small firm that conducted mining operations in The Great Mines. With a small fortune made by mining and selling forging materials into Heartland, Zowie gradually built a military force for himself, mainly hoping to stay safe and keep himself secured in the times of chaos. After the People's Justice defeated Emanuele in the River Lands and dominated the south and the west, Zowie went to John Ramsey and offered his service. He was welcomed and given the code name Bear. After years of fighting battles for the People's Justice, he became Aarav Castillo's second-in-command and fought with him against the UCA. Zowie was also a key role behind the crackdown on Kapala's forces in the Hollow Valley as well as the Barca's Crusades to Colony Prime and beyond against Conrad Isen. 
Xavier Bradley was one of the top generals in the UCA forces. A member of the famous Bradley family from Hestia's Valley, Xavier was a skilled warrior, tactician and loyal friend to Rico Franklin. The Bradleys and the Marshalls were close relatives and had the tradition to tutor and train their children together. Xavier kept top performance in his generation while maintaining close company with Bradley, his brother and the Marshall brothers, Jeor and Mario. Loyal, kind and determined, Xavier was liked by all. Xavier fought in the War against Don Calamity and saved Rico's life more than once from the cutthroats sent by the tyrant in the Colony Prime. During a battle against the forces of Lucien, Don's adopted son, Xavier was shot in the left eye and still managed to take down Lucien's second-in-command officer. Xavier remained active in later years in UCA's battles against the People's Justice and the Ascended. Shortly after Rico's death, Xavier passed away as well in Hestia's Valley. 
Quentinn Spaatz was a master of statecraft and military affairs who came to Rico Franklin's service during his crackdown against the New Dawn Rebellion. Upon their first meeting, Franklin was deeply impressed by his insight on military affairs, state governance, and balance of power. Quentinn then served as Chief Advisor to Rico for many years. After the Crisis at the Babel Tower, Quentinn and River Dean, the cunning young strategist of the UCA, urged Rico to expand his military power by marching into Baptisland, the fertile and wealthy land west to Hestia's Valley and the financial center of Unity controlled by the noble Baptiste family. Following the UCA's Conquer of the Dark Bandits, which destroyed the military support Max Baptiste could obtain from the bandits in the north, Quentinn encouraged Rico to send his troops to the River Forks to fight against the Baptiste army, although they outnumbered Rico's forces by five times. Since by then River Dean, the strongest supporter of the military move, had died of illness on his way to the north to fight the Dark Bandits, Quentinn persuaded Rico into taking action. The Battle at River Forks would turn out to be the most important victory for Rico in his power ascension in the north, even more important than the Sack of Titanus since the battle basically wiped out the entire elite forces of Max Baptiste and left Titanus, the Capital of Baptisland, exposed to attack. It is fair to say that Quentinn was the greatest contributor to the fast development of the UCA in the early years and its smooth operations of bringing the north under Rico's control. 
Renzo Clark was a human strategist and military consultant working for the UCA. He was a mysterious man who came to Rico Franklin from nowhere but won his trust with his unconventional strategists. He was known for using wild and spontaneous schemes and was therefore given the nickname the Joker. During the battle at Titanus in Baptispland against Max Baptiste, faced with two times the troops on the enemy side, Renzo surrounded from all sides of the enemy, using only twelve elite squads to put on constant surprise attacks. Renzo's strategic bluffing induced fear among Max's soldiers, who were convinced that they were outnumbered and doomed. Max's army soon collapsed and fled in panic and disorder. The victory won by Rico Franklin and his UCA forces were later referred to as the Sack of Titanus, which officially marked the fall of the Baptiste family and the switch of power in the north.Renzo was also one of the few who warned Rico Franklin about the potential scheme set up by the alliance between the People's Justice and the Ascended at the Port of Noyce but failed to persuade Rico to pull back in time. 
Mario Marshall, Rico Franklin's remote cousin and true friend, was one of the top generals of the UCA and Rico's most trusted ally. Mario grew up with his brother Jeor in the Forge, and was very close to the Bradley brothers. He considered himself quite mediocre compared to the shining Xavier Bradley. Knowing his limits, Mario was hard-working and strong-willed. He attended the Unity Military Academy and achieved high grades in most subjects. Before graduation, Mario dropped out to to support Rico Franklin's military operations against Don Calamity. He was later appointed as Defender of the Cage in Hestia's Valley, because the Cage is a strategically important city for the UCA for its proximity to both Heartland and Ascension. Though he once lost the town to the cunning Niccolo Barca, Mario fought bravely to fend off several rounds of attacks from Amari Williams the Panther, the legendary general from the People's Justice determined to take the city and sent out signal corps to ask for rescue. In the end, Mario's perseverance and dauntless courage won him and his men enough time for the arrival of support, including Brandon the Pallbearer, General Jean-Luc Darlan and eventually Dwayne Dowding. At great cost, with Brandon killed and Jean-Luc captured, Mario and Dwayne managed to hold the line and force Amari to pull back as a result of exhaustion and lack of supplies. The great battle would be later referred to as the Siege of the Cage. 
Major General Cresseno was a loyal and experienced advisor who worked for the Baptisland warlord, Max Baptiste, for many years. He was always straightforward in expressing his concerns about the decisions Max made, especially those involving military moves, which sometimes was seen by Max as contemptuous and disrespectful. Cresseno was strongly against Max's strategy of fighting against Rico Franklin's troops at the River Forks, but his opinion was ignored, and he imprisoned for interfering with the military order. After the Baptiste army suffered a sound defeat, Cresseno heard the news and laughed in despair, saying, "There is no coming back from that." Max, furious, executed him in prison. 
Antares was a fearsome android warrior and one of the top commanders of the Ascended. Antares was a communication and strategy humanoid. When Borom of the New Dawn Rebellion led his forces and surrounded Sir Law Pearson and his men in the North Canyon for several weeks. Antares decided to break the siege to find rescue since Sir Law once helped the injured cyborg find replacement parts to fix his receiver system. Antares sneaked out at night and rushed to the People's Justice base for help, who agreed and sent forces to crush down on the rebels and save Sir Law and his troops out. The humans were surprised by the bravery and decisiveness of the little medical droid. Years later, Antares served in several factions before he joined the Ascended and became a leader of android troops, where many were like him from all sorts of backgrounds. Antares's talents in the military operations were recognized by Mizar during the battle and recommended to Merak. When Merak came to rule, Antares was assigned to fight the rebels and bandits on the south and the east of Ascension and managed to bring all local tribes and factions under his command. He was later appointed as lead commander of the Ascended special force guarding south Ascension. 
Noah Leahy was from one of the principal families long residing in Hestia's Valley. The Leahy had a proud and honorable reputation. They served the leader of Hestia's Valley for many years as advisors in state affairs. It was said that the Leahy were among the first colonists settling in the valley and made a promise that their descendants would keep the land peaceful and fertile. Noah contributed a lot to the economic stability and development of Hestia's Valley and offered valuable advice to Rico Franklin, both in development affairs and military expansion. He was among the lords and officers, including Conrad Isen, who was with Rico Franklin on his death bed, listening to his final words. However, after Rico's demise, he supported Conrad Isen in seizing power and forced Joseph, the abusive ruler, to step down to restore peace and order to Hestia's Valley. 
Harris Baptiste, a cousin of Max Baptiste, was a warlord from the north. He was a reasoned and ambitious man and known to many as the Commander of Phantoms. Harris was a highly trained military man who served in Baptiste's forces in Titanus before becoming a warlord in North Baptisland himself. A cousin of Max Baptiste, Harris controlled the second-largest city in the Baptispland prior to the Unity Wars. He was most known for leading his elite specter troops called the Phantoms and for cracking down effectively on rogue bandits wandering on the northern borders. As a result, the ordinary people in north Baptisland were grateful for the protection and stability Harris brought to them and supported his ruling. Harris was among the warlords who answered the call of Rico Ramsey to end the tyranny of Don Calamity. However, after the war was won, he and Max Baptiste held a grudge against each other on interests and territories in the north. Though Harris managed to win the first battle against Max with the support of Aarav Castillo sent by John Ramsey, he was soundly defeated later in the second battle due to great disparity in military strength. As a result, Harris was imprisoned and later executed by Max. 
Dwayne Dowding was a lieutenant general serving in Rico Franklin's forces who won multiple battles during the War against Don Calamity. After Don's fall, Dwayne was sent by Rico to claim the Babel Tower and its encryption key so that their army could have the two great symbols of power on the planet and gain control of Unity. However, when Dwayne and his squad arrived at the tower, they found both the encryption key and Polaris, head of the Communications Division, went missing. Dwayne later led UCA's tech division and researched on super programming in order to solve the encryption issue. Dwayne fought at the Battle of the Port of Noyce against the alliance army between the People's Justice and the Ascended. Though the Battle at the Port of Noyce was a sound defeat of the UCA, he contributed greatly in securing the safe retreat of their remaining forces. During the Siege of the Cage, Dwayne was called to rescue Mario Marshall after the fall of two UCA commanders, Jean-Luc Darlan captured and Brandon Bessaun killed. He arrived in time to ward off Amari's forces, who had been dragged into the battle for too long and kept the Cage intact. Later during Emmon's Rebellion, Dwayne Dowding was assigned by Conrad Isen to carry out the counterinsurgency operations. Although he successfully put on a surprise attack and besieged Emmon, he succumbed to the wound in the head after he was shot by a sniper during the final assault. 
Tiger Tassigny was a major general who served as Captain of the Planetary Guard, the UCA's security unit. Tiger made his name known during the Battle at the Port of Noyce. As Captain of the Planetary Guard, he was responsible for the safety and security of Rico Franklin and his son Joseph. When Franklin was defeated at the Port of Noyce, Tiger's contingency plan secured the pullback route for Rico, minimizing the casualties of the UCA's remaining forces. Later in the Battle of Storm's Edge, Tiger intervened and secured Rico Franklin's safety again when Rico was pursued and almost taken down by Luqa Storm, the leader of the Deathwheel forces and furious son of Iago Storm. While it was an embarrassing narrow escape for Rico, it became the turning point in the clash between the Deathwheelers and the UCA. Eventually, Rico would turn Luqa's own men against him and chase him away, bringing the Outskirts, the Baptisland, and Hestia's Valley all into his control. Thus it is fair to say Tiger played a vital role in the UCA's ascendance in the entire north. 
Kapala was the head of a heavily armored bandit group living in the western borders of Heartland and the commander of a type of special forces called Vanguards. Kapala provided shelter and weapons to Sean Calamity after the exile warlord was defeated by Niccolo Barca of the People's Justice. He planned to take advantage of the conflicts between Sean and the People's Justice to invade more lands further into Heartland. To end the bandit riots once and for all, Niccolo Barca lured Kapala and his followers into the Hollow Valley and showered them with bombs. No one in the Kapala forces survived. 
Chimera was an explosives expert and the wife of Sean Calamity. She was hot-tempered, fearless and always loyal to her husband. Born and raised in Colony Prime, Chimera joined the Unity Defense Army at a young age. While she was trained in the ordnance corps, she also discovered the rebellious soul living inside her. Chimera met Sean, Don Calamity's younger brother, before the Sack of the Capital, the turmoil that ended the Oligarchy. The two fell for each other at first sight and soon got married.The experience of following Sean Calamity into the battlefields throughout the years made Chimera a seasoned trooper and a respectful leader. She was hot-tempered and sometimes stubborn, yet always loyal to Sean, her husband and best friend. Sean Calamity was grateful for having her by his side, even at his lowest when he was exiled to the Lawless Zone. After being captured by Aarav Castillo, Chimera, like her husband, refused to surrender. She was later released and returned to his side. No matter how unfavorable the condition was towards Sean, Chimera always supported her husband. 
Keats Franklin was the greatest poet in the history of Unity. Born to the famous Franklin family, Keats was distinctively aware from a young age that he was not like any of his brothers or even his father, Rico Franklin. He had a loving heart for peace and genuine interests in the life of ordinary people, young and old. Although Keats had no love for armoires, fighting, or commanding troops, he accepted training as required in his family tradition. He was actually quite talented in military and political affairs. However, Keats always preferred spending time writing poems and chatting with other poets over tea and snacks. Thanks to his peace-loving personality and excellent abilities shown in handling the UCA affairs, Keats was favored by some of the UCA officers as a better successor of Rico Franklin compared to his elder brother, Joseph Franklin. After Rico died, Keats feared that Joseph may see him as a threat and kill him. He wrote a long poem to his elder brother, expressing his respect for Joseph and his love for the family. Keats stated the wish to be dismissed of his duties in the UCA so that he could live an ordinary life. To the surprise of many, Joseph agreed and allowed Keats to relocate to the north of Hestia's Valley. 
Brandon Brooke served as a major general in the forces of Iago Storm, the Deathwheel Commander. He was famous for his fearless style of fighting in the battleground, leaving no mercy to his enemy and himself. He was thus called Brandon the Pallbearer. After Iago was killed by Rico Franklin, he continued to work for his son Luqa Storm. The latter found shelter at the place of Major General Slanoll, Quartermaster Dep of the Planetary Government. When Luqa left Slanoll to join the People's Justice in the Heartland, Brandon decided to stay and pledged loyalty to Slanoll. He fought bravely for Slanoll in the battle against Rico Franklin when the UCA attacked the Middle Lands. After Slanoll surrendered, he spoke highly of Brandon to Rico Franklin. The latter offered him a leader's position in the UCA elite force, which Brandon accepted. Later, Brandon was sent to rescue Mario Marshall, Rico's cousin, who was guarding a city in the southwest of Hestia's Valley called the Cage after Amari Williams from the People's Justice attacked and sieged it by surprise. Outnumbered, Brandon refused to surrender and fought to his last breath. His sacrifice won time for the UCA to assemble Dwayne Dowding who eventually fended off Amari in the end. 
Born to the noble Farrell family in Baptispland in troubled times, Lakicia was smart, well-educated, and at the same time, a rare beauty known to only a few. Following the Sack of Titanus when Max Baptiste was defeated, Lakicia Farrell was captured with her family by the UCA troops. They were imprisoned as war criminals since the Farrells supported the Baptiste family for years. Composed and vigilant, the girl, who was only 18 years of age, tried to negotiate and talk her family out of the punishment that the UCA officers try to impose. Her calmness, innocence, and beauty impressed Rico Franklin when he happened to come down to the prisoners' camp for some other business. Rico decided to set her family free and considered Lakicia an ideal candidate to be his future daughter-in-law. He wanted her for Joseph, his son and successor. She was smart and from the right family, whose influence in Baptisland would help him more conveniently stabilize the North. Rico's plan turned out to work quite well. Lakicia liked Joseph, and the two married some years later. When Joseph ascended to the peak of power after Rico died, claiming himself Planetary President, Lakicia became First Lady of Unity. 
A master tactician and seasoned warrior, Ben Montgomery served as a general in the UCA's forces and top commander of the advanced shock trooper division called Thunder Corps. A young soldier from Baptisland, Montgomery attended the Unity Military Academy and graduated with first honor degree. Before joining the UCA, Montgomery served in Max Baptiste's forces during his early years. He was promoted to major general for his defeating Harris Baptiste, Max's cousin and warlord in North Baptisland. During the great war between Max Baptiste and Rico Franklin at the River Forks, he was defeated by Hans Franklin and captured. In fact, Montgomery and his Thunder Corps were so famous that the UCA used a tactic proposed by Quentinn Spaatz, a top strategist of the UCA, to target at capturing them alive. Believing that he will be a valuable asset to his military ambitions, Rico set Montgomery free. He appointed him lieutenant-general in the UCA forces. Montgomery continued to lead his Thunder Corps and fought bravely for Franklin in the Battle at the Port of Noyce.Composed, intelligent, and proud, Ben Montgomery would go on to serve a remarkable long time in the UCA, almost 50 years in total. He fended off numerous attacks from the People's Justice on the southwest borders. He was also one of the main contributors who effectively stopped Barca's Crusades from pushing further into the north. To honor his contribution, Montgomery was promoted to general in the UCA army and appointed as Guardian of the Outskirts.
Oda Andou was a talented strategist working in the UCA forces towards the end of the Unity Wars. Oda was the youngest son of Jiro Andou, a renowned scholar from Hestia's Valley and Rico Franklin's loyal supporter and a moneybag. The Andous was among the most prominent families dating back to the beginning of the Unity colonization. He stayed with his father, Jiro, during the chaotic times as his student and assistant, where he learned statecraft and handling of military affairs. Seeing the planet torn apart, Oda prayed for peace and unity. Determined and devoted, he grew up to become a highly trained military man with extensive knowledge and a firm belief in the strength of the UCA regime. Oda always lamented for not having the chance to fight alongside the legendary strategist Conrad Isen or against the big names from other factions such as AlphaCen or Niccolo Barca. He was born too late. Oda became a high-ranking strategist officer, thanks to his outstanding performance and, to some extent, his prominent family background. He led the final attack against the People's Justice, marching towards New Avalon with Wylde Wallace, another military strategist of the UCA, equally cunning and yet more venturous. Oda led his army to confront the forces led by Kenta Omoi, Niccolo Barca's student and Chief Strategist of the People's Justice, and managed to gain the upper hand in the battle. However, his contribution to the UCA's final victory was shadowed by the surprise attack put up by Wylde Wallace, who took a detour and sacked New Avalon, forcing its ruler, Henry Ramsey the Cub, to step down. 
Lyuka was the only daughter of Lucien. She inherited her father's talent in combat and military affairs. She was trained to be a great warrior from a young age. Lyuka had a love-hate relationship with Lucien, who left her mother to be with Eris Ning. She never liked her step-mother Eris, but she did not show this dislike. Instead, Lyuka would rather spend her time in her unit of the Unity Defense Army. Sometimes Lucien would show up and offer some advice. More often, Lyuka would train with Major General Cransinski, Lucien's friend and subordinate, and his Oppressor troops. Jun told her that she was agile and calm in actions, and she should keep it that way. After Don Calamity was defeated, Lucien fled with Eris in such a hurry that he had to leave Lyuka behind. It pained her to admit how much his abandonment hurt her - a betrayal as seen by Lyuka that she never truly recovered from. With the help of a small troop sent by MG Cransinski, Lyuka managed to escape to safety. Due to her identity as Lucien's daughter, she was tracked relentlessly by bounty hunters and scavengers for rewards paid by other warlords. Unwilling to seek shelter at his father's, Lyuka stayed with her squad and defeated the offenders times and again. As a result, she made her name to many as a dreadful enemy. After Lucien died, Lyuka went back and lived in Hestia's Valley.
Lucien was thought to be the greatest warrior in human history. He was the adopted son and right-hand man of Don Calamity as a general in the Planetary Defense Army and a primary enforcer of law and order in the Capital. Lucien once held off three top generals, namely John Ramsey, Amari Williams, and Victor Nguyen, alone without taking a single scratch. He later stabbed Don Calamity in the heart after knowing his adoptive father was pursuing his wife, Eris, when the UCA began their assault. Lucien had to escape with Eris in search of a haven. Seen by many as disloyal, his only real sin is being easily manipulated. Orphaned as a boy, he is desperate for love. Lucien will put the interests of anyone he saw as "family" before all else, even if it means slaughtering innocents. After Lucien formed a tentative alliance with John Ramsey, Nguyen, less trusting, broke this alliance and sought to drive out or eliminate Lucien while Ramsey was away. Lucien fended off the attacks and drove Nguyen from New Avalon, intending to keep it safe until Ramsey's return. Ramsey, however, only saw an attack on his friend and his land and refused to hear Lucien's pleas for peace. Lucien and Eris were driven out of the Heartland, barely escaping with their lives.
Don Calamity was a powerful warlord who turned a cruel tyrant who seized control of the planet after the Oligarchy was ousted from the Capital. Before being destroyed by the Coalition, he ruled Unity with an iron fist, executing all that dared question him. Don led an overindulgent lifestyle, enjoying lavish parties and feasts. He pillaged the planet for as much wealth as possible, and life for the general population became worse still under his reign. Under his rule, it was common for loved ones to go missing in the night and never return.Lucien, Don Calamity's adopted son and second in command, was his army's true power. While Lucien had secured the planet for Don, he would also become his eventual downfall. Don Calamity had become smitten with Lucien's lover Eris, a woman known for her beauty across the universe, and took her for himself. Not long after, Lucien's knife found Don's heart in the halls of the Capital, and Lucien fled with Eris, leaving the Capital in turmoil once again.
Arcas was a senior counselor of the Ascended on internal affairs and specialist in economic development and effective governance. He used to be a professor of colony economy at Unity Institute of Economy in the Capital before the war began. He was originally human, some 100 years ago, before incorporating the newest cybernetic technology at the time. No one was sure of how old Arcas was since he always appeared as a young, sporty and good-looking humanoid male. He was an old friend of Polaris. Some said they knew each other from the founding of Unity. The two loved to grab a drink at the coziest bar in Ascension called the Twinkles every time Polaris was back from the Capital. Arcas became an advisor to Mizar after Polaris died and offered valuable advice on governance and development matters. When Mizar was dying, he asked Arcas to continue to help his brother Merak as the Ascended would need his wisdom and knowledge. Arcas was one of the several who opposed the alliance between the People's Justice and the Ascended but was later persuaded by Niccolo Barca. He continued to serve Merak for many years and was highly praised both by leaders and the people. 
Amari Williams, the Panther of the People's Justice, was a lifelong friend of John Ramsey and one of the most fearsome fighters on the planet Unity. He was proud, composed, and had a legendary sense of honor. Like John, Amari also swore an oath to restore peace and prosperity for the ordinary people, especially the weak, the poor, and the underrepresented. After the Sack of the Capital, Amari started to serve the People's Justice that John founded faithfully for his entire life. As a skilled warrior, he was rarely seen using a gun of any kind. Amari preferred to get in close combat with his enemies, where he could do maximum damage. It was said that the sight of the Panther would cause legions of soldiers to break ranks. Amari had two sons, Tristan and Tyan, who both served in the People's Justice army. The Panther General was famous for his strong sense of honor. He was once captured by the UCA following a defeat suffered by the People's Justice. Amari was appointed as a UCA lieutenant-general by Rico Franklin, the Supreme Leader who always admired the Panther's military abilities. So duty-bound was Amari that he refused to flee and return to the People's Justice until he had repaid the debt owed to Rico Franklin. During the Battle of the River Forks, Amari single-handedly broke through the lines of Max Baptiste's forces, slaying one of his finest commanders. With his debt paid, he returned to the People's Justice. Franklin was so impressed with Amari's loyalty that he ordered his men to stand down and allowed him to leave. Amari later launched the attack to the Cage, a city controlled by the UCA, but suffered defeat due to fierce resistance from Mario Marshall and other UCA commanders. During his pullback to Heartland, Amari was captured by the cyborg forces of the Ascended, a secret operation targeting at him orchestrated by Master Strategist Proximo and executed by Major General Orion, later known as "Operation Cold Gun". He was taken to Turing to have his fate decided by Merak, where he refused to surrender and was executed. The Panther's being backstabbed by the Ascended led to the collapse of the alliance between John Ramsey and Merak, which would eventually lead to the Battle at the Three Craters Dam. 
Heralded as the greatest strategist on the planet and quite possibly in the universe, Niccolo Barca, aka Falcon of Justice, commanded the entire army of the People's Justice. A top graduate of the Class of Legends from Unity Military Academy, Niccolo is an accomplished statesman and John Ramsey's most trusted advisor. In the later part of his career, he stepped in as acting Director of Heartland with Ramsey's self-imposed exile and defended the borders against all the odds.Niccolo's reputation for impeccable strategy preceded him wherever he went and his presence on any battlefield gave all enemy strategists pause and forced them to question even the most basic decisions. The most famous story is the Battle of Long Vale, where Conrad Isen's army outnumbered Niccolo's by 100 to 1. Niccolo decided to hide his troops in the bushes. When Conrad and his forces reached the clearing, they saw only Niccolo and Aarav Castillo sitting together, playing chess and enjoying tea. With Niccolo's reputation for strategy and Aarav's reputation as an unmatched sniper, Conrad was convinced his forces were walking into a trap. They retreated from their position in fear of an ambush that would never come. The stresses of leading the People's Justices' armies, running the government of Heartland, and being the primary ambassador finally caught up with Niccolo. He collapsed on the battlefield during the Crusade against the UCA. The strategist fell into a deep coma and never woke up again. All of Unity mourned the loss of one of the greatest minds to ever set foot on the planet, even including his great enemies such as Conrad Isen and Montalban.
John Ramsey the Lion was the founder of the People's Justice, the most powerful warlord in the southwest, and the Guardian of Heartland. He was known across Heartland and beyond as a charismatic and virtuous man of the people. Born to a farming family in Heartland, John Ramsey grew up poor but managed to gain a scholarship to attend the Unity Military Academy and graduated with high honors. He served on the Unity Defense Army as a lieutenant, before joining the original United Colonists Alliance and helping to overthrow Don Calamity. In the aftermath of the UCA's rebellion, he became struck by the greed and avarice exhibited by the leaders of the planet. He resolved to free the planet of these tyrants and restore peace and equality to the planet.Following the Rico Franklin's ascension in the north, John decisively won the election after returning from fighting in the Capital, becoming the Guardian of Heartland. Through his charisma, he managed to gather many great warriors, strategists, and politicians to his side. What Heartland lacked in resources, he helped make up by surrounding himself with talented people. Through John's leadership, Heartland expanded its borders greatly until his devastating defeat at the hands of Montalban of Ascension, later known as the Battle in the Three Craters Dam. John married Alkaid, the daughter of Polaris and sister of Merak and Mizar and the couple had one son, Henry Ramsey. Despite the ongoing conflicts between the People's Justice and the Ascended, they lived happily in New Avalon until John's eventual exile. 
As the supreme leader of the United Colonists Alliance, aka the UCA, Rico Franklin is an ultimate utilitarian: pursue the best result, no matter the cost. Rico started his life as a military commander in bringing his family forces to join the crackdown upon the New Dawn Rebellion, a cult led by Solomon and his disciples. He and his son Joseph ruled Hestia's Valley from their the Forge. With their seat of power reliable in the industry, they have a mighty and well-equipped army. After the war against the New Dawn rebels, the Franklins made their name known among the northern warlords. When Don Calamity took advantage of the victory in the repression of the New Dawn Rebellion and abused his military power, Franklin was the only person willing to openly oppose him. Therefore, Rico considered all the other potential leaders to be unworthy, too cowardly to make good leaders. Some may have been more popular and charismatic. Still, they were all too naive, too worried about disturbing things, like "morality". After unseating Don Calamity, Rico Franklin "invited" the Planetary President to reside in the Forge, thus keeping the legitimate government of Unity under his own control with the Planetary President in their hands. With the supreme power secured, Rico went on to defeat Max Baptiste, taking over the wealthy Baptisland, Max's family land and the financial center of Unity. He then murdered Iago Storm, who controlled with his Deathwheelers, the northwest part of the continent called the Outskirts, and chased away his son Luqa Storm. With those two accomplishments, Rico Franklin and his UCA officially united the north of Unity, bringing Hestia's Valley, the Baptisland, and the Outskirts all into his control. The Great Mines to the north of the Colony Prime technically fell under his influence as well. Turning his eyes to the south, Rico Franklin hoped to bring all of Unity under his rule. He would be fiercely resisted by John Ramsey of Heartland and Merak of the Ascended and dragged into a long-lasting war. However, his eyes were always on the seat of supreme power at the end of his conquest road.
Barachiel was a mysterious mechanic who spent most of the time wandering in Ascension all the way from Turing to the far south borders. He was often seen carrying his box of tools and parts and offered free treatment to androids and cyborgs who could not afford to fix their bodies. Some said he was a member of a scrapper gang in disguise, targeting the defenseless weak for parts; some claimed he was a kind healer who always gave a helping hand to the helpless; others swore he was an alien capable of fixing any system with foreign technologies. But one thing is for sure, Barachiel was good at what he did. 
Luqa Storm the Gator was a great warrior and general of the People's Justice. He was famous for his lightning speed of attack on the battlefields. Luqa Storm was the eldest son of Iago Storm, leader of the Deathwheel force ruling the Outskirts. Furious upon the deaths of his father and younger brother Linus Storm at the hands of Rico Franklin, Luqa succeeded Iago's position as leader of the Deathwheel army and attacked Rico Franklin's lands with Sabas Shale, his sworn brother and Iago's adopted son. They took over several towns controlled by the UCA within a short time. However, he was soundly defeated before reaching the Forge by Rico Franklin. The latter managed to drive a wedge between him and Sabas. Though he managed to escape, he had to almost kill Sabas Shale and thus lost his best brother for good. He later found shelter at the place of Major General Slanoll, the quartermaster of the Planetary Government. He fought for him against Victor Nguyen the Boar, the second most powerful general of the People's Justice, and broke even with him. His military abilities impressed John Ramsey, the leader of People's Justice, who managed to persuade him to join his forces. With the code name "Gator," Luqa served as a general and fought loyally for the People's Justice.
Montalban is a next-generation android created in Ascension and a brilliant and calculating strategist. Many in Ascension question his methods, but the results of his strategies are indisputable. Montalban assumed Chief Strategist in the Ascended Supreme High Council, succeeding Kentarus. Most famous for his defense and subsequent counter-attack at the Battle of Three Craters Dam. Montalban sacrificed multiple cities along the Golden River to lure the People's Justice deeper into Ascension territory. When his strategy was questioned, he responded: "A few cities are a small price to pay to tire the armies of the People's Justice. John Ramsey is blinded by his fury. He will surely overextend into our territory and pay dearly for it." When the People's Justice made camp outside of the Three Craters Dam, they were weary from the extended campaign into Ascension, and the security around their camp was too lax. This allowed Darius Bloodclaw to sneak into the camp and plant explosives leading to a crushing defeat of the People's Justice without the Ascended ever needing to meet them in the open field.Montalban also defeated Lance Franklin in the Battle at the Temple of Ruins, further making him an irreplaceable role in Turing and for the Ascended army. 
Damon Cooper was a colonel serving in the UCA forces and a martial arts master. His fighting talent was discovered by Xavier Bradley. Thanks to Xavier's recommendation, Damon became the personal guard of Rico Franklin, the UCA leader. During the battle between the UCA and Don Calamity's Unity Defense Army, Damon saved Rico's life when their forces were attacked by Lucien, the greatest warrior on the planet. When Rico Franklin marched into the Middle Lands, Gene O'Brien, a warlord who had previously surrendered to the UCA, betrayed. He launched an air raid at the dead of night to the Poorman's Hut, the townlet Rico and his forces stayed at, which was later called the Bombing of Poorman's Hut. At the same time of the assault, a group of assassins hired by Gene attacked Rico. As Rico's bodyguard, Damon fought bravely against the intruders. He killed three of them using bare hands, as his arm weapons had been deliberately impaired before the attack. He won time for Rico Franklin to get away and died on-site due to fatal injuries on his chest. 
The younger brother of Don Calamity, Sean was in charge of the Heartland until being driven out shortly after the UCA took Colony Prime. Stronger and arguably smarter than his brother, he continued to be a thorn for Heartland for some years. His insurgency against the ruling of the People's Justice brought trouble and casualties and was remembered as Sean's Rebellion. After Sean was exiled to the Lawless Zones, which was north to Heartland and deep into the west of the Outskirts, he managed to build a new force and started to take lands from Heartland again. However, the exile was no match to Niccolo Barca, strategist of the People's Justice. Sean was captured six times, only to escape or negotiate his release in exchange for hostages within a month each time. Finally, after arresting him a seventh time, the ever-pragmatic Niccolo Barca saw a use for him. He stroke a deal with Sean and his gang: serve as a vanguard for the People's Justice and gain a real colony once the war is won.While he did not achieve many great victories in his own right, Sean Calamity has been thought by some to be indestructible. Others say bullets were incapable of penetrating his enormous belly. During their first night of drinking as allies, Aarav Castillo is said to have told Sean, "I have shot you TEN TIMES, and TEN TIMES I've watched armor-piercing rounds bounce off that gut of yours." Calamity's belly rumbled with uproarious laughter in response.
Qi Nguyen the Osprey was an outstanding young commander from the People's Justice, leading the shock trooper forces. Born to the well-known Nguyen clan from south Heartland, Qi was the second child and only daughter of Victor Nguyen, the Boar General of the People's Justice. Qi's mother was a Bradley, a warlike family of warriors and crusaders from Hestia's Valley. It is fair to say Qi inherited the fighter's genes from both her parents.  Serving as her father's aide-de-camp, Qi observed how Victor used military strategies and tactics in the battles and was good at memorizing and practicing them. Called as "Softie" by Victor the Boar, Qi was no fool in the fighting. She was decisive, smart, and quick. Growing up with J.J. Ramsey, son of John Ramsey and Tristan Williams, son of Amari Williams, the Osprey outsmarted them both from many senior officers' perspectives. She was later appointed colonel in the People's Justice army, fighting alongside Baram the Goat. 
Visha was a prominent saboteur, sniper, assassin and expert liar during the early stage of the Unity Wars. He was a firm supporter of the legitimate Planetary President.Living in the Capital, Visha was known to be a quick-witted merchant and skilled garment maker who opened chain stores in most Unity parts. His real identity was Honorable Discharge from the intelligence division of the Unity Defense Army. He worked with various warlords during the crackdown on the New Dawn Rebellion and the War against Don Calamity. Those who knew Visha from his fashion business regard him as a friendly and charming fellow, while the top warlords who saw him conduct his business revere him as the most fearsome tailor on the planet. It was said that many would flee on hearing the name of Visha or seeing his squad symbol. Visha was also known for his resentment toward Rico Franklin, the leader of UCA and "President-wannabe", as Visha would call him. When Rico Franklin had the President relocate to the Forge, Visha organized an assassination attempt targeting the convoy, trying to freeing the President and ending Rico. However, Rico was anticipating Visha's arrival and schemed a counterattack to the assassin squad. Rico had Visha captured and the rest of his team killed on sight. That was the first and only failure of the tailor. Although the UCA later executed Visha, his assassin organization and garment business continued to run. 
Kyla was an orphan from a slum in Serenity of the Outskirt. She learned how to use blades and guns at an early age as a necessary skill to survive life in the slums. She enlisted as a charger in the Unity Defense Army and was sent to Heartland to crush down on the newly founded People's Justice. Aarav Castillo's forces besieged her unit. While her incapable leader surrendered, she managed to lead her squad and broke away from the enclosure, which impressed Aarav, leaving him wondering who squad commander was. When Kyla and the other survivors returned to the place where UDA camped, they overheard that the general was executing those who lost the battles against the Heartlanders. Furious and disgusted, Kyla led her squad back toward New Avalon, trying to find a haven for themselves, a place to sleep and food to eat, when they ran into Aarav's forces again. Greatly outnumbered, Kyla ordered her men to stand down and surrendered. Aarav recognized Kyla as the breakaway commander and invited her to join his troops, which Kyla agreed after some struggles. Her military talent was soon fully discovered and given full play to after serving in the People's Justice. She fought alongside Aarav the Wolf her whole life. The two were best partners in the field, and Kyla would eventually marry Aarav and be called the She-wolf. 
Conrad Isen was a mastermind of military strategies. Ambitious, meticulous, and responsible, he was the most important asset to the UCA after the death of Rico Franklin, its visionary leader, and was named Chancellor of Unity. Conrad had two sons, Clovis and Aerrias.Born to a wealthy family who resided in the Bellows district of the Forge. Conrad answered Rico Franklin's call for all talented youths to apply for military positions. Conrad quickly rose through the ranks, and Franklin sent Conrad a formal invitation to serve in the capitol building. Conrad saw in Rico Franklin a man he believed would unite the planet under a single banner once again. The respect Conrad gave Rico was returned in kind and not long after joining the top UCA generals, Franklin promoted Conrad to command the armies of the UCA. The two men achieved great success together.As Rico lay on death's door, Conrad made a promise to faithfully serve his son Joseph. Conrad would soon learn this is a promise he would have no choice but to break. He saw Joseph abuse his power, who declared himself the new Planetary Governor, increased taxes, and conscripted thousands of poor people to fight while allowing the rich to sit idly in the Bellows. The winds of change were upon Hestia's Valley, and Conrad decided his primary service was to Hestia's Valley and not to the Franklin family.He began supporting the people's movement in secret, but as the protests and riots moved through the Forge, Conrad revealed himself the leader of the movement to Joseph. He stepped into Joseph's quarters and told him, "Too long have you ignored my pleas to soften your policies on the farming and working-class people of Hestia's Valley. Your poor judgment destroyed all the hard work of your father. You must step down. The people and I no longer believe you have the ability to unite this planet." Joseph agreed to step down.Conrad became named Chancellor and Hestia's Valley entered a new era. Under his command, the UCA finished the work of Rico Franklin. They swept through Heartland, and Ascension fell soon after. Conrad became the new Planetary Governor and began a dynasty on Unity.
Schedar was AlphaCen's uncle and a financial expert from east Ascension. He had rich experience in taxation and finance thanks to his experience of working as the Director of Finance in Unity's financial center Baptisland. Schedar began his service in the Ascended when Polaris rode south from the Babel Tower. Foreseeing greater changes that would happen to the crumbling regime, Schedar left Baptisland in a hurry and was welcomed by his nephew at the Port of Noyce, who expected his arrival. Schedar had long wanted Polaris to assert more power for the sake of cyborgs, and was always ready to support him. After the untimely death of Polaris, he continued to work for Mizar and Merak consecutively as a faithful advisor, supporting Ascension with his insight in state affairs, especially in the financial sector. As wars came expensive, Schedar was known for his discretion and dealmaking in the gold world. He also advised against impulsive decisions of Merak on military operations. Schedar was loyal and diligent his entire life. During the Samaritan Epidemic, he contracted the deadly virus during his trip to the banks in south Ascension and developed fatal blood contamination, a worst-case scenario for a cyborg. Although Rigel, a major general of the Ascended, eventually found the cure, it was too late for the senior statesman's failing body. 
Alkaid was a cunning, decisive and beautiful cyborg leading the specter troops in Ascension before her marriage to John Ramsey, the Lion and founder of People's Justice. Throughout her life, Alkaid tried to maintain peace and stability in the south, bringing the two powers together, and yet failed her biggest dream. Alkaid was the only girl among the adopted children of Polaris. She was personally taught by Polaris, one of the founding fathers of Unity, and grew up in the military. Alkaid was offered the chance to lead the Ascended following Mizar's death, but she turned it down. Instead, Alkaid chose to spend her time carrying on what Polaris and Mizar left behind, helping the less fortunate and looking after the multiple orphanages. Alkaid married John Ramsey when the humans from Heartland and the cyborgs from Ascension forged an alliance to fight against the UCA in the north. Though the marriage was entirely political and there are continual conflicts between the two powers, Alkaid and John adored each other and lived happily in New Avalon. Alkaid became aware of AlphaCen's cabal of android supremacists through her contacts in Ascension, and also his success in persuading Merak on the plan of waging war against the People's Justice.  She sought to preserve peace and prevent the two sectors from going to war. Alkaid found no option to avoid this without exposing the plot, except the assassination of AlphaCen. Unknown to her husband, brother, or any other contacts in Heartland or Ascension, Alkaid hired mercenary assassins from the Lawless Zones to kill AlphaCen and make it look like an accident. Alkaid's plan was a success, and AlphaCen died of a mysterious illness. The attack was called off, however, the alliance between the two factions had become increasingly strained due to the demise of AlphaCen. Following John Ramsey's exile after the Battle of the Three Crater's Dam between the People's Justice and the Ascended, Alkaid saw the reunification of the two powers impossible to achieve and left Heartland in great disappointment. Her final whereabouts were unknown as Alkaid did not return to her brother Merak either. A few years later, some claimed that they saw Alkaid work at an orphanage in a remote town in the southern tip of Ascension. When Merak sent his men there, no one said they knew the lady they were describing. 
Lieutenant General Kostya Kasowski was a strategist-turned commander, a seasoned military man with sharp wits and combat skills. He was calculating, cautious and decisive.One of the top graduates from the Unity Military Academy, Kasowski joined the Unity Defense Army and earned his reputation as a cunning tactician. When the UCA controlled Colony Prime, he pledged loyalty to Rico Franklin, the warlord who would later unite the north.Kasowski became one of the top officers in the UCA army and a trusted advisor to the Franklin family. He fought in multiple battles against the People's Justice and the Ascended and won almost every one of them. After the alliance between the People's Justice and the Ascended fell apart, Kasowski, along with Maj. Gen. Joyce Arcbar and Maj. Gen. Benjamin Celmy, led the UCA forces won the critical battle against the Ascended, aka the Battle in the Meteor Vale, where Kasowski's strategy lured out Merak, the top leader of Ascended, and destroyed two-thirds of their elite troops. Although Merak was able to escape back to Turing, the victory helped the UCA secure a long-run peace and good order on its southeast borders.After Rico Franklin passed away, Joseph Franklin waged war against the Ascended, initiating Operation Thunderbird, an ambitious attempt to bypass the defense of the Ascended and attack Turing. The operation was commanded by Liam Franklin and supported by Lt. Gen. Kasowski and Colonel Rendyl Reynolds. Due to Liam's misjudgment and the Ascended strong resistance, Kasowski and his men were separated and trapped in the Ruhre Valley by the Golden River. Kasowski was forced into close combat with Col. Menkent of the Ascended. Unfamiliar with the terrain, Kasowski and his squad were all eliminated. With their commander killed, Kasowski's force surrendered to the cyborgs. The loss of Lt. Gen Kasowski was a heavy blow to the UCA in its southern frontier. 
Bliss the Buzzard was a cunning, ruthless and highly efficient strategist and among the most prominent commanders in the People's Justice. Losanna Bliss was born in Colony Prime and moved to Heartland following his father's appointment as the inspector of the Unity Space Port Program. Losanna attended the Unity Military Academy and graduated with First Honor. He was in the same class with Niccolo Barca the Falcon and Kostya Kasowski, the well-known UCA commander. Bliss started his career in the Unity Defense Army but fell victim to Don Calamity's abuse of power, during which he was branded a traitor, imprisoned and tortured. After Don was killed and his followers fled, Bliss was reinstated since the Planetary Government was in an urgent need of experienced officers. However, Bliss was extremely disappointed and chose to quit. He joined the People's Justice upon the recommendation of Niccolo Barca and was given the code name Buzzard. Following the People's Justice's expansion into the River Lands, the Middle Lands, and beyond, Bliss the Buzzard played key roles in the defense of New Avalon and the counter-offensives in the Middle Lands. He was instrumental in planning part of Battle at the Noyce Port, one of the most decisive successes of the People's Justice and the Ascended. When the People's Justice was marching into River Lands, Bliss led his forces towards Barren Canyon, as part of the plan to surround Australis, the capital town of the River Lands. His whereabouts and intention were closely monitored by Dene Bola, head of enemy's intelligence division and a proficient assassin. Experienced and cautious, the Buzzard, however, did not realize his moves were exposed. The second he stepped into the Barren Canyon, he was taken down by Dene Bola and his squad. The loss of the Buzzard was not a failure that John Ramsey would accept lightly.
